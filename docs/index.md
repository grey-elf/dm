# Introduction

## Goals
Unify and balance the "Vecna Trilogy" as a single campaign meant to be played all the way through, converted for fifth edition.

1. Convert the adventures to 5e and rebalance them to be played through as a single campaign starting at 1st level.
2. Strengthen the story tonally, too many aspects that should be serious and scary instead come off as silly and goofy.
3. Thematically unify all three adventures, tying elements introduced in the later ones back into the earlier.
4. Rework some of the more problematic elements, primarily those related to mental health and race.

## Major Changes
### Overall

- Vecna's portfolio is secrets, his becoming a lich was a means to an end. More focus should be put on him as a god of secrets and magic than of undeath.
- The Serpent should exist as a through line across all three adventures/parts
- Cult structure has been reworked somewhat
