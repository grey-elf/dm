# Introduction

## Goals
Unify and balance the "Vecna Trilogy" as a single campaign meant to be played all the way through, converted for fifth edition.

1. Convert the adventures to 5e and rebalance them to be played through as a single campaign starting at 3rd level.
2. Strengthen the story tonally, too many aspects that should be serious and scary instead come off as silly and goofy.
3. Thematically unify all three adventures, tying elements introduced in the later ones back into the earlier.
4. Rework some of the more problematic elements, primarily those related to mental health and race.

## Major Changes
### Overall

- Vecna's portfolio is secrets, his becoming a lich was a means to that end. More focus should be put on him as a god of secrets and magic than of undeath.
- The Serpent should exist as a through line across all three adventures/parts
- Cult structure has been reworked somewhat

### Vecna Lives

- The Book is truncated to effectively end with the events in the secret temple beneath the Scythe and Sheaf, the chapter in Osnabr√∂lt has been moved to Book 2 and the rest have been entirely done away with

### Vecna Reborn

- Several characters either have their roles added on to ones already introduced in Vecna Lives, combined into a single character, or transferred to wholly new characters. Most of them are actually introduced in Book 1, in order to have them be more established in the campaign by Book 2.
    - Marit's role has been combined with Cylene Saxinus, already introduced in Vecna Lives
    - The role of Vocar, Marit's uncle, has been split between Oaklin and Diraq Malcinex
    - The roles of Virianis and Dast (caretaker and "king", respectively) have been combined into a single character, Virianis Dast
    - The role of Larossa Baru is roughly transferred to Miral Cutterfro, who already had a similar role in Vecna Lives
    - The role of the Loreward Banquo is given to a new character who is also given the name of Larossa Baru
- Decided the "Book of Inverted Darkness" doesn't really make sense as a name and replaced it with the Book of Vile Darkness in keeping with more recent lore that the Book is a single artifact and that Vecna had a hand in its creation.
