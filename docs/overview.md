*Note to self: Might add an extra chapter at the beginning of Book 2, where party returns to the temple and gets information on the sword at Osnabrölt, as well as the handout about the Book of Inverted Darkness. If there is another natural place to insert the Osnabrölt story earlier, this might instead be part of chapter 2 and only include the handout.*


## Vecna's Plan

Only Vecna himself knows if he had foreseen Kas' betrayal, and perhaps even intended on it as part of some greater plan. It is surprising that one as powerful and paranoid as Vecna would grant anyone a boon that could lead to his own destruction, let alone one that would encourage it, unless that was precisely what he wanted.
