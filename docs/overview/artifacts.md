### Greatsword
Location: Osnabrölt  

Aspect: The Destroyer\*, Kas as warrior and bodyguard. Brutal, bloodthirsty, ferocious.  

> You are Kas, the Destroyer. Fear grips even the mightiest champions when you step onto the battlefield.   


> Any normal sword made to such proportions would be virtually unmanageable by a human, but the magical endowments of the Sword of Kas allow it to be handled by any warrior with grace and ease, albeit with two hands.

### Longsword
Location: In the possession of the false Kas  

Aspect: The Bloody-Handed\*, Kas as warlord and general. Remorseless, severe, unyielding.  

> You are Kas, the Bloody-Handed. As grand general of Lord Vecna's armies, you order them as an extension of the Whispered One's will, an unrelenting force of opression and conquest that bathes the land with blood in his name. The well-regimented legions of slaves, soldiers, war wizards, and untold undead are at your command, waging devestating campaigns of war. Entire cities are razed, others are enslaved either for service or experimentation. No sacrifice is too great, those that fall will simply serve again in another form. ...
