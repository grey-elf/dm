# The Cult of Vecna

Secretive and small, the Cult of Vecna on Oerth venerates the memory of the ancient arch-lich turned demigod, plotting and preparing for his eventual return.  

With his name struck from the memory of the Oerth, the Cult of Vecna is never referred to as such. Instead, it is normally called the *Cult of the Whispered One* by the few who even know it exists. Individual cells of the cult use names such as the following:  

- Followers of the Whispered One
- Disciples of the Hand and the Eye
- Maimed God's Chosen
- Servants of the Spider Throne

Until the adventure's beginning, the cult had been biding their time and spreading their reach, but had been mostly kept in check by the Spurned Cult of Iuz, their chief rivals. Still, their prophecies forewarned their lord's return in this year, and they had been making preparations. Further details on Vecna's plan can be found in the [Story Overview](../overview.md#vecnas-plan)  

> No matter how powerful a being is, there exists a secret that can destroy him. In every heart is a seed of darkness hidden from all others; find that evil seed, and your enemies are undone. Strength and power come if you know and control what others dare not show. Never reveal all that you know, or your enemies will take your seed, too.  

## Hierarchy

### The Voice of Vecna

Short of the Whispered One himself, the Voice is the highest position in the hierarchy of the cult. As the title implies, this position may only be held by one who speaks with Vecna's voice: his manifestation.  

The position is left vacant until such a time as the manifestation of Vecna chooses to reveal itself to the cult. After the [prologue](../vl/0-a-prologue.md), the rank is wrongly given to Halmadar, until things are set straight.  

### The Heart of Vecna

With the position of the Voice often vacant or detached from the day-to-day happenings of the cult, much of the actual leadership comes down to the Heart of Vecna. The Heart is the highest member of the priesthood, and it is through the Heart that the commands of the Whispered One are put into motion by directing the cult.  

Traditionally, the Heart of Vecna wears unadorned blood-red robes.  

The current Heart of Vecna is Her Most Enigmatic Excellency, Sublime Mistress of the Whispered One, [Diraq Malcinex](dramatis-personae.md#diraq-malcinex) of Ket.  

### The Eye and the Hand

Through secret rituals and flesh-warping magics, the cult turns two of their faithful into beings known as the Eye and the Hand. These powerful creatures act as the Heart's lieutenants and enforcers and as such they only answer directly to her. When required, the Eye and the Hand are sent to assist individual cells of the cult in times of need, and will unquestionably follow the cell's Thought in order to complete their mission. But every cultist knows where the creatures' loyalties lie, and fear of the Heart's wrath keeps them from being used in any attempt to further a Thought's personal ends.  

### The Thoughts of Vecna

Each cell of the cult is lead by a high priest known as a Thought. The Thoughts lead the cultists both as an apparatus to carry out the plots of the Whispered One and as a congregation in worship of him. Lesser priests of a cell are subservient to the Thought, but may turn to using threats of blackmail against their superior in bids to take their position. The sheer power of the Thought usually keeps such attempts at bay.  

Traditionally, Thoughts of Vecna wear black robes patterned with forking lightning, signifying the speed and power of thought.  

The Adytum, the primary temple of Vecna and the cult's main headquarters, is led by the **First Thought of Vecna**. While all other Thoughts are of equal rank, the First Thought stands above them. The current First Thought of Vecna is [Ugwaerel Malcinex](../dvd/dramatis-personae.md#ugwaerel-malcinex).
