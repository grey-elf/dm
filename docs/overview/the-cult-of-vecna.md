# The Cult of Vecna

Secretive and small, the Cult of Vecna on Oerth venerates the memory of the ancient arch-lich turned demigod, plotting and preparing for his eventual return.  

While his name is struck from the memory of Oerth, the Cult of Vecna is never referred to as such. Instead, it is normally called the *Cult of the Whispered One* by the few who even know it exists. Individual cells of the cult might also use names such as the following:  

- Followers of the Whispered One
- Disciples of the Hand and the Eye
- Maimed God's Chosen
- Servants of the Spider Throne

Until the adventure's beginning, the cult had been biding their time and spreading their reach, but had been mostly kept in check by the Spurned Cult of Iuz, their chief rivals. Still, their prophecies forewarned their lord's return in this year, and they had been making preparations. Further details on Vecna's plan can be found in the [Story Overview](../overview.md#vecnas-plan)  

> No matter how powerful a being is, there exists a secret that can destroy him. In every heart is a seed of darkness hidden from all others; find that evil seed, and your enemies are undone. Strength and power come if you know and control what others dare not show. Never reveal all that you know, or your enemies will take your seed, too.  

"Twice yearly they must sacrifice large quantities of magical items to Vecna." (VL74)

## Hierarchy

### The Voice of Vecna

Short of the Whispered One himself, the Voice is the highest position in the hierarchy of the cult. As the title implies, this position may only be held by one who speaks with Vecna's voice: his manifestation.  

The position is left vacant until such a time as the manifestation of Vecna chooses to reveal itself to the cult. After the [prologue](../vl/0-a-prologue.md), the rank is wrongly given to Halmadar, until things are set straight.  

!!! note "Vecna's Manifestation"
    While the majority of Vecna's power is trapped beyond the planes, he can gather enough of it to channel into creating a manifestation akin to a lesser avatar. Echoing his title as the Maimed God, Vecna's manifestation takes the form of a humanoid maimed in some way, usually having lost one or more limbs to violence. The manifestation can be any humanoid creature, of any age, sex, gender, or race. The appearance it takes on is usually one that will further Vecna's needs.  

    A **manifestation of Vecna** has the stats of a **lich**, with the following changes:

    - Its creature type is humanoid.  
    - It loses the lich's ***Rejuvenation*** and ***Turn Resistance*** abilities.  
    - Its ***Disrupt Life*** ability affects each non-undead creature within range excluding itself.  
    - It does not have a lair and cannot take lair actions.  
    - It has a Strength of 14 (+2), a Wisdom of 19 (+4), History +19, Insight +18, Perception +11, and +11 to Wisdom saving throws.  
    - It has a Passive Perception of 21.  
    - It knows all languages.  
    - It can cast the *legend lore* spell at will, without requiring components and without expending a spell slot.  
    - ***Spidered Insight.*** As a bonus action, the manifestation targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the  manifestation's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the manifestation wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target or that the target knows. The target is not aware that this ability has been used on it.  
    - If the manifestation is destroyed, it takes 1d100 days for Vecna to gather the power to form a new one. The new manifestation may take the same or a different form as he wishes.  
    - The manifestation may have other features and abilities depending on the form it has.  

    If the manifestation regains the Eye and Hand of Vecna, it becomes even more powerful.  

### The Heart of Vecna

With the position of the Voice often vacant or detached from the day-to-day happenings of the cult, much of the actual leadership comes down to the Heart of Vecna. The Heart is the highest member of the priesthood, and it is through the Heart that the commands of the Whispered One are put into motion by directing the cult.  

Traditionally, the Heart of Vecna wears unadorned blood-red robes.  

The current Heart of Vecna is Her Most Enigmatic Excellency, Sublime Mistress of the Whispered One, [Diraq Malcinex](dramatis-personae.md#diraq-malcinex) of Ket.  

### The Eye and the Hand

Through secret rituals and flesh-warping magics, the cult turns two of their faithful into beings known as the Eye and the Hand. These powerful creatures act as the Heart's lieutenants and enforcers and as such they only answer directly to her. When required, the Eye and the Hand are sent to assist individual cells of the cult in times of need, and will unquestionably follow the cell's Thought in order to complete their mission. But every cultist knows where the creatures' loyalties lie, and fear of the Heart's wrath keeps them from being used in any attempt to further a Thought's personal ends.  

### The Thoughts of Vecna

Each cell of the cult is lead by a high priest known as a Thought. The Thoughts lead the cultists both as an apparatus to carry out the plots of the Whispered One and as a congregation in worship of him. Lesser priests of a cell are subservient to the Thought, but may turn to using threats of blackmail against their superior in bids to take their position. The sheer power of the Thought usually keeps such attempts at bay.  

Traditionally, Thoughts of Vecna wear black robes patterned with forking lightning, signifying the speed and power of thought.  

The Adytum, the primary temple of Vecna and the cult's main headquarters, is led by the **First Thought of Vecna**. While all other Thoughts are of equal rank, the First Thought stands above them. The current First Thought of Vecna is [Ugwaerel Malcinex](../dvd/dramatis-personae.md#ugwaerel-malcinex).  

!!! note "Cult Ranks and Stat Blocks"
    ex: In many cases, Memories and Thoughts might be less powerful than Teeth, but their greater devotion gives them a higher rank within the religious hierarchy.
    
    As Vecna's power is regained, his followers also become more powerful. Over time, even those in lower ranks of the cult are represented by creatures with greater CRs, and they are granted additional special abilities. These new abilities are gained when the Manifestation of Vecna recovers the Eye and Hand of Vecna (at the end of Vecna Lives), and then again when the ritual is carried out to draw in the powers of Vecna from the Outer Planes so he can be reborn (at the end of Vecna Reborn), but when he is drawn into the Demiplane of Dread his remaining followers on the Prime Material Plane lose some other abilities as well. This will be addressed in each book.
