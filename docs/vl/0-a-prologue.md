# A Prologue: Wherein the Circle of Eight Begins a Membership Drive

## The Circle of Eight

No need to treat your players like children, just tell them that for a prologue they will be playing different characters. If your players *are* children, this probably isn't the right adventure for them.  

Let players each chose a member of the Circle of Eight, any additional will be effectively run as sidekicks. Tell the players to think about how their character might know this wizard, but they don't need to decide yet.  

## The Mound

The interior stonework is still largely intact, but becomes more cracked and worn deeper into the mound. Passages are clear of roots.  

In the fourth paragraph, the result of a collapse should instead read:  
"The stone in a five foot area gives way, cascading rock and dirt into the tomb. Each creature under the collapsing roof must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fortunately, the tree roots keep such collapses from becoming worse. A collapse will not block a passage, but the area becomes difficult terrain."  

In the fifth paragraph, possibly describe that the wards on the tomb *feel* empowering, but the mechanical effects are negligible. The bonus to player saving throws and penalty to enemy attacks are ignored. Describing the feeling of the empowering wards is worthwhile in order to make note of the sense of losing them in the final chamber.  
Limitations on spells to escape are unchanged.  

## The Occupant of the Mound

Additionally, the seals and enchantments on Halmadar's prison were so potent that the pervasive evil of the Hand and Eye of Vecna weren't able to dissipate, instead building up and concentrating within the inner chamber of the mound. As Halmadar raged and starved in his prison, the evil of the artifacts manifested his emotions as sorrowsworn.  

## Investigating the Mound

As soon as the Circle of Eight arrive at the mound, Halmadar is warned of them by a premonition from the powers of the Eye and the Hand. He then expends 2 charges from the Eye to cast *clairvoyance* and places the sensor near the party. Everything else is the same except for anything to do with ESP.  

Remove the final paragraph entirely.  

## 1. Entrance

Unchanged.  

## 2. The Outer Seal

Treat mold as **Yellow Mold** from DMG.  

## 3. The Vaulted Chamber

!!! note ""
    This octagonal chamber arches up perhaps ten feet. The opposite wall has an archway leading into an unlit passage. In each of the other six walls is an alcove where a large humanoid statue stands. On a slightly raised dais in the center of the room is an unadorned stone sarcophagus. The impressive stonework is obviously aged and starting to crack, seeming worse for wear closer to the far entrance.

The corruption of Halmadar and the artifacts are responsible for the accelerated decay deeper into the cairn. The statues nearer to the far archway are mostly broken.  

The sarcophagus in the center is unadorned and empty aside from some stone dust. It was intended for Halmadar's consort, but was never used due to the circumstances of his internment.  

Once all eight wizards are in the room and have spent some time looking around, but before any of them try to leave out the other door, 4-6 of the statues animate as **stone golems** and attack the members of the Circle.  

## 4. Magical Trap

Removed.  

## 5. Pit

Attempting to climb around the pit requires a DC 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, part of the pit edge, wall, and ceiling collapse and send the character into the pit. The fall and rubble deal 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage.  

Hiding in the murky water at the bottom of the pit are three **Wretched**.  

## 6. The Inner Seal

A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check will identify the inscriptions as being abjurative in nature, made easier (DC 10) if the outer seal was also examined, casting *detect magic* also reveals this. A DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows the deduction that the ward is intended to keep something in, not out.  

In one side of the inscribed slab, there is a small crack. Spotting this requires a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Through this, the decay that has worn the rest of the cairn has leaked.  

This seal cannot be opened, broken, or otherwise manipulated until the wards are removed, which requires casting *dispel magic* with a DC 19, as if a 9th level spell.  

## 7. Halmadar's Prison

!!! note "Replace the last two sentences of the boxed text with:"
    A large stone platform fills one end of the chamber; atop it is an elaborately carved throne. The wood has begun to rot away, and a husk-like corpse is sits upon it with broken, rusted chains scattered around it, and a massive greatsword leaning against its side. On the floor before the platform is a large, intricate ouroboros, painted in what could only be blood.

*With the exception of the first paragraph, replace the entire rest of the section with the following:*  

The body on the throne is none other than **Halmadar the Cruel**, if his *clairvoyance* spell is still active he is motionless while still focusing on it for a moment longer, but not long enough to make a difference in the following events. Hiding among the piles along the walls are the sorrowsworn manifestations of the warlord's rage at his internment and the starvation that lead to his death: 3 **Hungry** and 4 **Angry**. These sorrowsworn count as Halmadar's allies.  

The wizards have little time to orient themselves in the chamber. Not being one for subtlety, Halmadar engages the members of the Circle almost as soon as they enter his prison chamber. Prepared by the premonitions of the Eye and the Hand, and possibly the sensor of his *clairvoyance*, he is ready for them. Halmadar has advantage on his initiative roll, and all other creatures in the room are surprised for the first round of the encounter.  

Halmadar is boastful, claiming victory as soon as combat begins. He taunts the Circle for falling into his trap and freeing him. He thinks that he is Vecna, introducing himself with many of the archlich's titles as he rises from the throne and hefts his sword, but when he speaks the name "Vecna" it is instead heard only as a faint, incomprehensible whisper.  

After the first round where the wizards and the sorrowsworn are surprised, combat proceeds as normal. It is *required* that the Circle of Eight fall here. This fight should be impossible, and it should feel impossible, but it shouldn't feel cheap. As much as possible the players should feel like they were fairly beaten by an unbelievably powerful foe, and not like they were cheated (such as by instant kills while time is frozen). If required, have more sorrowsworn emerge from the detritus, thematically they should be **Angry** since Halmadar spent much longer being angry than hungry, but some **Hungry** can be included for variety. For the purposes of this encounter, Halmadar cannot be reduced below 1 hit point.
