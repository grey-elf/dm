# Chapter 1: A New Beginning

## A New Beginning

Ignore everything before the box text.  

Split the box text in two by paragraphs. Use the first part to establish the scene, then have each character describe and play out some of what they are doing that afternoon. Then continue with the second part.  

Each character receives a vision of the moment of their wizard's death in the Prologue. This can be from the perspective of the wizard, the killer, or as an unseen observer. No matter what the killer is unclear. As they die, each character hears their wizard speak to them.  

> "Find the others, warn Mordenkainen: The Circle has fallen."  

The rest of the section is unchanged.  

## Off to See the Wizard

In the second paragraph, replace "Cymeria" with whichever character is associated with Tenser.  

A summary of information that all the characters would know and might be helpful in this part:  

- As with almost all wizards in the city, all members of the Circle of Eight are members of the Guild of Wizardry
- Mordenkainen is very rarely in the city, he lives in his mountain citadel, far away

Additional information unique to each character based on which member of the Circle they know may also be helpful now, or later in [Chapter 3](3-research.md).  

Tenser  

- Tenser lives in a castle on the southern shore of the Nyr Dyv, which is relatively nearby, but visits are unwise without invitation
- Tenser often stays with Jallarzi or Otto on his not-infrequent visits to the city, you know where their homes are and have briefly visited both while Tenser was staying there

Rary  

- Rary lives in Lopolla, in Ket
- Rary occasionally travels to Greyhawk to visit his younger brother, Arklan Sammal, a professor of Baklunish history at Grey College who you have become acquainted with

Otiluke  

- Otiluke is the president of the Society of Magi, and by extension part of the Directing Oligarchy
- Otiluke lives in Greyhawk and is rarely out of the city, you know where his house is and have visited him there before
- Otiluke sometimes visits with Otto or Jallarzi, and has indicated to you which part of the city they each live in

Jallarzi  

- Jallarzi lives in Greyhawk, in the High Quarter, and you have visited her home on occasion
- Jallarzi is friendly with the Constable of Greyhawk, Derider Fanshen
- Jallarzi is an ardent worshipper of Pelor, and is friendly with the High Matriarch at the Temple of Pelor in the city
- Jallarzi is very close to Kieren Jalucian, the Guildmaster of Wizardry, and rumors are that she and Jallarzi are romantically involved

Depending on how they put their information to use, the party have many ways to try to track down Mordenkainen. The most straightforward option would be visiting the Guild of Wizardry, but other ideas can be explored as well.
