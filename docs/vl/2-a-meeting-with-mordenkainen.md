# Chapter 2: A Meeting with Mordenkainen

## The Roc and Oliphant

### Teleconferencing

- the members of the Circle had contingencies in place to contact trusted agents in the case of their demise
- once the severity of the divinitation blackout was determined, Mordenkainen and the Circle got involved
- they began to research why such a thing might happen
- working theory is that some great calamity is on the horizon, great enough that the future is  unclear
- and the blackout is spreading
- with the Circle he began to research the possibility of this happening before, and what might be causing it now
- but got pulled away to handle some other threat (that he won't share) and left the rest of the Circle to it independently
- needs PCs to pick up the Circle's trail and find where it ends
- he will come from the other direction, tracking the growth of the blackout and determining where the origin is
- why them? He needs agents, and the Circle apparently trusted them enough for the contingency
- how? research in the city: libraries, experts, temples
- when he had to leave, the book *The Chronicle of Secret Times* seemed promising, might be where to start

### The Attack

**Group 1** (in the tavern)  

- 1 Memory of Vecna (**Cult Fanatic**)
- 4 Disciples of Vecna (**Cultist**)

**Group 2** (at the back door)

- 2 Fingers of Vecna (**Spy**)
  - fingers dyed red

Group 2 does not get involved unless the party attempts to escape through the back door.  

**Group 3** (in the garden)

- **The Hand**
- **The Eye**
- 2 Blood of Vecna (**Thug**)
  - Red face paint, will fight to the death

**Almarth the Halt** (**Bandit Captain**) - Out on street  

Almarth, also known as the Halt for his game leg, is a tall, stocky man. His complexion and build clearly mark him as one with Rhennee blood. His head is shaven clean and he keeps it brightly polished. A jagged scar runs from the back of his neck to up above his left ear. He sports a thick, black mustache and goatee. Gold-coin earrings dangle from his ears. He has a noticeable limp in his right leg, a reminder of the time a giant almost shattered his right knee.  

Almarth dresses in the style of a Rhennee noble, although he is not of that esteemed rank. His clothes were clearly once expensive, but are now worn and faded. Ill-fitting and mismatched, they were also clearly not tailored for him. Each piece was taken from his victims or stolen from a poorly guarded laundry line. Almarth would never imagine paying for anything.  

!!! note "Note for revision"
    Fight might have been too easy. Party was not motivated to run.
    Make group 3 scarier to flush into main room quicker, make group 1 scarier to drive out front or back quicker.
    Use group 1 placement and fleeing commoners to guide party out either front or back.
