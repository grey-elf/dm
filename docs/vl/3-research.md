# Chapter 3: Research & An Interlude

## The Libraries

### The Library of the Wizard's Guild

Second paragraph should begin:  
"The Head Librarian for the Guild is Jawal Severnain (LN **drow mage**, they/them)."  

Adjust all following text with Jawal's correct pronouns.  

!!! note "Map"
    Due to its strange shape seeming appropriate for the Wizard's Guild, [The Great Library](https://dysonlogos.blog/2016/05/27/the-great-library/) by Dyson Logos is an appropriate map for this library if one is needed. Expansion can be taken [Beneath the Great Library](https://dysonlogos.blog/2016/05/31/beneath-the-great-library/) if desired.  

### Grey College

blah blah blah...  

Also at the College is Arklan Sammal (LN human **master sage**, he/him) who is a historian of some repute and a professor of Baklunish history at the school. He is also Rary's younger brother.  

### The Great Library of Greyhawk

!!! note "Map"
    Should a map of the Great Library be required, Dyson Logos' [The Grand Library of Coruvon](https://dysonlogos.blog/2016/08/05/the-grand-library-of-coruvon/) would make a good choice. As a mundane civilian library it has a more normal architecture, which helps contrast it with the stranger Library of the Wizard's Guild.  

### The Books

In order to gain information from any of the books a character must be able to read the language the book is written in, either by knowing the language or a related dialect, or using an ability such as the warlock's *Eyes of the Runekeeper*. If the character knows only a related dialect, any scanning checks are made at disadvantage and fully reading the book takes the maximum possible time. If a character relies on *comprehend languages* to read or scan a book, the time to do so is doubled.  

If the characters are unable to read or understand the importance of any of the books, they should think to seek out experts in the city for aid.

sight pales  
the key will turn in the locked gates of Time

- Unchanged except for removing mention of Cult of Vecna
- *Revision notes:* 
    - Why does it say Osnabrölt is on the shore of Midbay?
    - The sketch map doesn't actually show Halmadar's tomb despite what the book text says?
    - Is it supposed to imply that the tomb is the hill marked "Kron"? I choose to believe it doesn't.

## Wizards' Homes

Three of the members of the Circle of Eight have homes in Greyhawk that they inhabit with varying degrees of permanency. Depending on which member of the Circle they were connected to, members of the party may know of some or all of these. Otherwise, they might find directions through other means.  

### Jallarzi Sallavarian

Jallarzi's mansion is in the city's High Quarter, at H16. It is described on GoF61.  

Jallarzi sent her servants on vacation before she left with the rest of the Circle of Eight. Her vast but unfurnished house is uninhabited except for Edwina, her pseudodragon familiar she left behind because of her not getting along with Otiluke.  

!!! note "Edwina"
    Edwina is Jallarzi's familiar, a wild pseudodragon that the wizard befriended some time ago. This means she cannot be dismissed or summoned using the *find familiar* spell. Edwina has the stats of a **pseudodragon (familiar variant)**. When found, she will be immediately friendly with any member of the party who is not Otiluke's contact, but she will become especially attached to one of them, in the following order of preference:

    - The character who is Jallarzi's contact
    - Any elf or halfling that is not Otiluke's contact
    - Any other character that is not Otiluke's contact
    - The character who is Otiluke's contact

    Kindness from Otiluke's contact will eventually earn Edwina's favour, and she will not stay friendly with any member of the party who is unkind to her. If the character she initially attached to is cruel or unkind to her, she will abandon the party.  
    With some effort, the character that Edwina became attached to can earn her trust and gain her as a familiar. Until this happens, that character does not get the benefits of her *familiar* trait.  

The mansion is largely unfurnished aside from the parlour, master suite, and a few guest suites. The master suite and two of the guest suites show evidence of having been lately occupied and not cleaned since.  

!!! note "What Edwina knows"
    - Jallarzi was very concerned with whatever she and the other wizards were investigating, but glad for the chance to prove herself
    - Tenser and Rary both stayed with Jallarzi in the house
    - She accompanied Jallarzi on trips to Grey College and the Guild library, as well as meetings with the other Circle members in the house, at the Guild, and elsewhere

### Otto

Otto's cottage is in the city's Garden Quarter, at G2. It is described on GoF63.  

!!! note "What the groundkeepers know"
    - Otto was staying for several weeks and seemed much more frantic than usual
    - He left a couple weeks ago and hasn't been seen since, which isn't unusual for him
    - He was meeting up with various other wizard-types, but particularly closely with a short, small-looking one (Otiluke) came by often

### Otiluke

Otiluke's house is in the city's River Quarter, at R15. It is described on GoF83.  

The house is inhabited by a handful of servants and a young woman named Glorial. Glorial (CG human **apprentice wizard**, she/her) is roughly half Otiluke's age (early 20s), and has been living with the older mage for nearly one and a half years now as his apprentice and, more recently, concubine. (Otiluke is a creep.)  

!!! note "What Glorial knows"
    - Otiluke was frantically investigating something with a group of other wizards she didn't recognize.
    - He was spending a lot of time with a curly-haired fat one (Otto) at Grey College.
    - They also visited several temples in the city. She's not sure which but assumes the House of Boccob to be a good place to start.

## Street

### The River Quarter

#### The Rhennee

- The priests of Trithereon or Olidammara know Yagos Slevak specifically
- The clannishness of the Rhennee makes questioning them difficult
- Asking about Almarth the Halt or Yagos Slevak will get back to them, and they will be smuggled out of the city
- Best way to get info is through an introduction, like through one of the temples. Xerbo is a good one for this
- Questions about the cult to non-cultists are met by fear and apprehension
- No matter how they approach questioning the Rhennee, they are eventually approached by Turim Varostak

!!! note "What the Rhennee Know"
    - Call the Cult of Vecna "The Cult of the Seeing Hand"
    - Know the cult to be an evil group that has been gaining traction among their clan (though won't name names, and don't know any in specific)
    - Know of **the Eye** and **the Hand**, and tell their children of them to scare them, but believe them to be real
    - ~~Recommend going to Dyvers or Verbobonc for more information, cult is more active there~~
    - Remember wizards nosing around the waterfront some weeks ago

##### Turim Varostak

[Turim Varostak](dramatis-personae.md#turim-varostak) is Vecna's manifestation on Oerth. He appears to be a tall, wiry, grizzled human sailor with thinning white hair and a permanent scowl. He is an honorary Rhennee, a fact indicated by a charm he wears dangling from his belt. His entire left side is badly scarred and mutilated. He has a peg in place of his left leg, a leather cuff ending with a hook over his left forearm, and a patch over his left eye.  

- Claims to be a bargemaster
- Has various different stories as to his injuries.
    - "A sahuagin attack down by Saltmarsh" etc.
- Acts as if wanting to help, actually wants the party's help in tracking down Halmadar and regaining his place as the Voice
- Knows information in "What the Rhennee Know" sidebar
- After answering basics, he will disappear for a night and extract all information that Yagos knows, Yagos is found dead the next morning
- Will only give Yagos' intel if party lets him come along on the journey (to avenge the honour of the clan that took him in) and offers his boat and crew
- Ingratiated himself with the clan by risking his life in attempt to rescue Avrel's brother, although he failed (or so he says, actually a memory implanted by the powers of Vecna). Hence his injuries

##### Yagos Slevak

[Yagos Slevak](dramatis-personae.md#yagos-slevak) is the leader of the Fingers of Vecna among the Rhennee and in the region. He is a weaselly, oily sycophant of a man who may seem helpless but is actually quite dangerous.  

- Rightfully mistrusted by most other Rhennee, but clannishness will still protect him unless outed as cultist
- Will not reveal status as cultist of Vecna
- Acts cooperative, hoping to lead the party into a trap far from the city
- Knows information in "What the Rhennee Know" sidebar
- Claims to have stumbled across a group of cultists in Verbobonc a few months ago and is being blackmailed by them
- Pretends to be afraid of the cult and requires significant payment in advance for his services
- Knows the location of the temple in Verbobonc and the rumors of Vecna's return
- Knows of the importance of Osnabrölt but doesn't know what's there
- Hopes to stay alive by being useful, will keep information to himself but offers to take party there in person

If his status as a cultist is made public, the Rhennee will turn on him. If they want his continued assistance, the party must negotiate for his life. This will only be allowed if the Rhennee can keep him under guard, requiring the party to travel with them.  

##### Almarth the Halt

The players might recognize him from the attack at the Roc and Oliphant.  

- If exposed, meets the same end as Yagos
- Knows as much as Yagos
- Cannot be forced to talk
- Won't go down without a fight
- Smuggled **the Eye** and **the Hand** into the city, as well as other cultists
- Will accidentally out Yagos as a co-conspirator if convinced that he was betrayed
    - Might not out Yagos as a cultist specifically, may only indicate he was the captain of the ship he served on when smuggling cult members into Greyhawk

##### Avrel Riskar

[Avrel Riskar](dramatis-personae.md#avrel-riskar) is a Rhennee noble and a senior member of one of the clans currently in Greyhawk.  

- Could be found just asking around or through introduction by priests of Xerbo
- Knows information in "What the Rhennee Know" sidebar

!!! note "Family":  
    - Husband: Marcel Vali (NG Rhennee human **druid**, he/him)  
    - Brother: Morlo Vergond (Deceased, he/him)  
    - Niece: Rona Fele (CN Rhennee human **swashbuckler**, she/they) [relevant in our campaign specifically, might cut from final]  

#### The Thieves' Guild

- Very territorial. Active mostly in Old City and River Quarter
- Will come down hard on anyone doing thief work on their turf
- Will take notice of anyone asking questions but won't approach
- Offer no information on events, despite knowing generally what has been happening. Don't want to be involved
- However will assist tracking down Yagos, since he has been cutting in on their business

#### The Beggars' Union

- Can be hired to seek out information
- No mention of cult, **the Eye**, **the Hand**, etc.: 10-50 gp
- With mention: 100-500 gp
- Can track down Almarth or Yagos in 1d3 days without drawing attention from Rhennee
- Cannot locate cultists or cult locations
- Cannot locate **the Eye** and **the Hand** but discover they were smuggled into the city by a Rhennee bargemaster
- Know the River Rat and the Green Dragon Inn to be Rhennee hangouts

#### The Shapechangers

- Probably won't use, throw together later if needed

!!! note "Low-level Shapechangers Encounter"
    Clannair Blackshadow : **Drow**  
    Imogen Gellett : **Spy**  
    Harral Shastri : **Apprentice Wizard**  

!!! note "High-level Shapechangers Encounter"
    Clannair Blackshadow : **Drow Elite Warrior**  
    Imogen Gellett : **Master Thief**  
    Harral Shastri : **Transmuter**  

#### The Cults

- Vecna cultists take notice as soon as PCs start asking questions in River Quarter but do not act, awaiting orders
- Stragglers of the Spurned Cult of Iuz take notice, first fearing that they are being targeted, but then becoming intrigued and eventually start tailing the party under orders from Iuz himself

### Elsewhere

See "Tracking" in An Interlude


## An Interlude

!!! note "TODO"
    - make spell failure more incremental
    - update effects on priest power to 5e rules
    - sightings should not mention Vecna specifically
    - tracking should be part of the research/investigation section


### Meal with Kieren

- Depending on which direction the party needs to be nudged in, either meet at the Savant (nudge towards libraries and college), the Green Dragon Inn (nudge towards the Rhennee and the River Quarter), or the Golden Phoenix (nudge towards high temples and the mage's homes)
- Review findings so far
- Award magic items
    - If she hasn't already, gives one of a pair of ***sending stones***, the other remains with her so they can stay in communication
    - 4x potions of healing
    - Offers each character a choice between two common or uncommon magic items that would be appropriate to them
    - 1x potion of any rarity (within reason) that Kieren thinks they would find useful


### Progression [Split and move this later]

- It's getting unseasonably cold and the Nyr Dyv is freezing over
    - This is exceptionally uncommon and very concerning
    - Ice starts in the north and has been spreading south
- The freezing Nyr Dyv is driving ships and monsters south, concentrating them more than usual, travel is dangerous
- With the weather turning and the Nyr Dyv treacherous, the Rhennee need to make wintering plans
- There are three Rhennee clans currently in Greyhawk, which is congesting the river and becoming troublesome for the city
- One of the three are going to have to set out to winter elsewhere
- None of the nobles want their clan to be the one to leave, fearing their safety
- Many of the folk want to stay where it's safe, also
- Some of the younger Rhennee don't want to just sit around and are willing to brave the lake for glory and the safety
- Once they realize just how dire the situation is, the 3 nobles will call a meeting at the Green Dragon Inn and begin deliberations
- While this meeting occurs, clan boundaries come up, Rhennee from different clans will not mingle
- Not all Rhennee in Greyhawk will attend the meeting at once, some will come and go, others won't come at all. They will not participate in the meeting personally, but are invested in the outcomes of the noble's deliberations
- The meeting is carried out entirely in Rhopan
- If the party wants to travel with the Rhennee, they could seek passage with whichever of the clans does not stay in the city, provided they pay for the service or are able to assure their usefulness aboard the ships
- But before they can do that, a decision has to be made on who stays or leaves
- If the characters have met Avrel Riskar already, they may be able to talk to him during one of the recesses in deliberations
- If they are on good terms with Avrel and play their needs well, he can be convinced to send one of his boats to take them to Verbobonc while the deliberations continue, but this will be exceedingly difficult
- If the players want to wait out the discussions, they drag on, proceed through the events of An Interlude
    - If things are totally stuck, have one of the three clans at random be the one to set out, and they can attempt to get passage with them
- If either Almarth or Yagos have been outed as cultists, the dynamic is different
- As members of Avrel's clan, Almarth and/or Yagos' identity as cultists casts a shadow on the entire clan
- This has put pressure on Avrel to be the one to agree to leave the city for the winter, the two other nobles pressing him on it
- So far Avrel's seniority has allowed him to hold the other two off, but it won't last forever (it will however last long enough to prevent the party from travelling with the clan in a timely manner)
- If they know that the cult is in Verbobonc, the party can convince Avrel that a) agreeing to have his clan be the one to leave and b) helping the party to Verbobonc to deal with the cult, will help regain his clan's standing in the eyes of the others
    - The difficulty with this approach is not in convincing Avrel of it, but in identifying it
    - It will require strong insight into Rhennee culture and the current social dynamic between the three clans here, which might be aided by a character coming from a culture with similar clannishness
- If convinced, Avrel will immediately and emphatically announce his clan's departure. They will set out the next day at noon
- As soon as the deliberations are concluded, the clan barriers fall and intermingling resumes, festivities starting for the night to send off the departing clan
- Avrel will only tell the bargemasters of the true reason of them going to Verbobonc, in order to track the cult. This means that Yagos, himself a cultist, knows unless he was outed as a cultist as well.

## Level Advancement

The characters advance from 4th to 5th level upon setting out from Greyhawk on the Circle of Eight's trail.
