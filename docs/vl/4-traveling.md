## Encounters on the Way

With the northern Nyr Dyv and the passages into it frozen over, travel across the Lake of Infinite Depths has become treacherous...

### Merrow Ambush


### Ice Floes


### Pirate Attack


### A Murder Aboard

Turim kills someone on board to perform the Ritual of Recession and speak the First Word.  

### Iuzite Encampment

While heading South on the Velverdyva River, passing the Gnarley Forest on the East, the characters may notice banners and ramshackle fortifications on the edge of the tree line. It is a moderately-sized forward operating base for the forces of Iuz, in the early stages of establishing camp. They are here to provide support to Beryn should he require it, and are at his disposal should he establish contact. Until then, their job is to make limited incursions into the Kron Hills to draw attention.  

## A Message from Kieran

At some point along the journey, the characters are again contacted by Kieren Jalucian if they have not contacted her again first. Kieren makes contact via the *sending stone* paired to the one she provided them, if she did so. Otherwise, she simply casts *sending* targeting the party member she trusts the most. The content of her message is as follows:  

> (Team/Character). Blackout worsening. Mordenkainen has made progress. Contact me only when secure in Verbobonc, do not risk cultists among Rhennee overhearing. Assume entire clan compromised.  

The message is somewhat unclear, but not enough to be incomprehensible. It may sound choppy and broken, or it may sound like Kieren is speaking from a surpassing distance. This is a side effect of the worsening blackout.  

If the party contact her first with a *sending* her response is, with 7 words remaining for a flexible response appropriate to their initial message:  

> Please confirm when you are secure in Verbobonc, do not risk cultists among Rhennee overhearing. Assume entire clan compromised.  

In this case, she will later send the following:  

> (Team/Character). Blackout worsening. Mordenkainen has made progress. Complex developments. Maintain no further contact until in secure location.  

## Level Advancement

The characters advance from 5th to 6th level upon arriving in Verbobonc.
