# Chapter 5: Verbobonc

Upon arriving in Verbobonc, the party's priority should be locating the cultists there. If they have ensured the Avrel they will track the cult to help regain his clan's reputation, or followed the information from Almarth that this is where he brought the cultists to Greyhawk from, this should be clear to them. But if they are fixated on the vague news they have from Osnabrölt or on the fate of the Circle of Eight, are confused, or are too focused on some other direction, they can be nudged in the right direction if required.  

If Turim is with the party and has either been told or somehow else found out that the party is seeking the Cult of Vecna, he immediately and very conspicuously begins asking around about the cult. It is in his best interest to do so, since even alerting the cult will help him find them and claim his rightful position as the [Voice of Vecna](../overview/the-cult-of-vecna.md#the-voice-of-vecna). This very quickly ensures that not only the cult, but other power groups in the city are aware of the party and their search.  

If the party travelled with Yagos ~~and are aware of his status as a cultist~~, he tells them that he will arrange a meeting with a contact of his within the cult that can get them to the temple in the city. The contact in question is [Oaklin](dramatis-personae.md#oaklin-the-half-elf). If allowed to meet privately, they make plans for Yagos to take the party to the Rock Powder Inn where they will rendezvous with Oaklin, who will then lead them to an ambush at the quarry at night, under the pretense of it being a cult ceremony and the party arriving as new inductees. If the two aren't allowed to converse in private, Yagos will meet Oaklin with any party members who wish to be present, and introduce them to Oaklin as potential new disciples. Yagos will attempt to secretly convey to Oaklin that they are actually enemies of the cult and need to be dealt with, his deception can be seen through by making a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by Yagos' Charisma (Deception) check. Characters who do not know thieves' cant make the check at disadvantage, and may be unable determine the actual meaning of the coded exchange. If the secret message is able to go by unnoticed and uninterrupted, Oaklin sets up the same plan as if the two of them were able to meet alone. *revision note: Yagos will play this slightly differently if he is known to be a cultist, or if he is acting as if he only knows about the cult and is acting out of fear of them.*  

If the party arrived with the Rhennee fleet and Yagos has not been outed, he secretly informed the Cult of the party and their investigation. This makes its way up the cult structure in Verbobonc, then the Thought of the Organ dispatched one of their top operatives to tail them: the leader of the Fingers in Verbobonc, [Oaklin the Half-Elf](dramatis-personae.md#oaklin-the-half-elf)

## News from Kieren

Whenever the party determines that they are in a safe location to do so, they can contact Kieren with a *sending* as indicated they should do when they were in transit. When they do so, if the *sending stone* was used, they might be surprised that the response comes in Mordenkainen's voice:  

> Have to trust your determination of security, we cannot scry you. Wait. We will be making contact shortly, this is a complex ritual.  

If Kieren is specifically targeted with a *sending* spell, she conveys something similar in her own manner.  

!!! note "Alternate Approach (for my game, will probably cut from final)"
    Option: Instead, Mordenkainen's response is  
    > I have arranged a meeting with the Bishop, he will be providing aid. Go to the Cathedral of St. Cuthbert, tell them Mordenkainen sent you.  

    When they do so, the characters are brought in by the priests (who were given descriptions of the party) to the Bishop's private garden. On a table is an assortment of finger foods. A few moments later the Bishop and Alimora come in. Once basic introductions are complete, the Bishop puts on a ring similar to the one that Kieren wore in Chapter 2, signaling to Mordenkainen that they are gathered, and the scene proceeds as below.  

Projected images of Mordenkainen and Kieren appear to the characters, meanwhile the two of them and Ravel Dasinder are in the peak of the pyramid that contains the Greyhawk University of Magical Arts.  

Details:

- The divination blackout isn't just spreading, it's becoming more intense in places
    - More and more divinations are starting to fail (lower and lower level spells)
    - Contact to the gods is becoming difficult (higher level cleric and paladin powers are failing)
    - *insert other things here depending on how much time has passed and following progression from An Interlude earlier*
    - Just this sort of telepresence is exceedingly difficult, the ritual is requiring all three of them to channel it in order to work, from a magically amplifying location (the wizard school), and even then it's unknown how long it will last
- It is also spreading, blanketing more of the Flanaess
    - List some countries affected
- Mordenkainen managed to track source of blackout to two sites
- One was deep within the borders of Iuz, and already thoroughly controlled by the Old One's forces
    - How was Iuz ahead of them in finding it? By the source being within its borders, the Empire of Iuz must have noticed and subsequently tracked and found the source faster
- The other was in southern Keoland, where Mordenkainen found it (maybe in the Dreadwood?)
- Site was a ruined temple, serpent and eye-in-hand imagery were prevalent, indicates cult connection and longevity
- In the temple, found a stone tablet that seems to be the specific source of the blackout
- Moving the tablet from the temple moved the blackout epicenter with it
- The tablet appears to describe some sort of ritual, it's imbued with extremely powerful magic, and is as old as it and the temple seem
    - It's difficult to tell for sure, all divination magic fails too close to it, so spells like *identify* are useless
    - Relying on mundane observation and research instead
    - [Our campaign specific] This was confirmed by a second opinion from a contact of Nystul's in the church of Bleredd, who was also reached by the vision of the Circle falling
        - Mordenkainen brought her to Verbobonc to meet them, she is waiting at the temple of Saint Cuthbert
        - The Bishop insists on knowing about the cult investigation, he has invited the party to lunch (whenever that makes sense to be)
- For now, he has taken the tablet to his citadel in the Yatil Mountains for study, which has lessened the blackout over Greyhawk

## The City

- City slogan: "Earth and Stone, Man and Gnome"


- His Noble Lordship, the Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc (LG Oeridian human **noble** or **veteran**, he/him)

Despite substantial mineral riches and significant trade power bringing much affluence to the Viscounty, not all of the region's residents are advantaged by this wealth, especially in the town of Verbobonc itself. Many were once caravaneers who lost their livelihoods to the vicious raids by the Horde of Elemental Evil in years past; others veterans of the Battle of Emridy Meadows some thirteen years past, who were left disabled and cast aside once the foe was routed; or adventurers left scarred and broken by the horrors of the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, which they delved into in effort to end the Horde's so-called "Second Rising" only a few years ago. They tend to settle near the town's docks, the most likely place for them to find shelter, work, or passage to better opportunity.  

Whatever the reason for their poverty, the arrogantly classist citizenry of Verbobonc try to overlook and ignore these destitute folk, leaving them to fend for themselves. Even the church of St. Cuthbert, so powerful in these lands, is more focused on stomping out evil than caring for the needy. As such, the poor and forgotten of Verbobonc have banded together, forging a strong comradery amongst themselves, working together and caring for each other's well-being. The epitome of this communal assistance is a man named Virianis Dast (NG Baklunish human **commoner**, he/him). Once a merchant and trader of significant respect, Virianis watched as his business died at the hands of the Horde's raids, eventually leaving him entirely bankrupt. He wasn't the first for this to happen to, and far from the last, but over time his cool head, humbleness, and kindness earned him no little respect as a mediator among the needy of Verbobonc, and a representative between them and the rest of the city. With his former connections among the Viscounty's merchant class and knack for logistics he also became something of a coordinator of how the community's resources are put to use. His position as a de facto leader of those living in poverty has earned him various titles, such as "the Beggar King," or "the Suffering Sultan." These were used derisively by the city at large but eventually accepted with some humor by Dast and his community.  

Even though he is later in his years, Virianis Dast spends much of his time moving about the city, mostly around the docks, checking on and catching up with the people of his community, asking after their concerns and making sure their needs are taken care of. Other times he can be found in a backroom of a particular warehouse down by the docks, the last remaining part of his old business that he has somehow managed to hold onto. The main space he shares with those who need it, offering them much-needed shelter, and in the back he makes his own quarters, meets with anyone who wishes to speak to him, and plans with others how to best distribute the community's resources. Virianis is rarely far from his "honor guard", rotating pairs of local teens (any non-evil alignment, any race **thugs**, any pronouns) who have taken it upon themselves to assist and protect him at all times. He has never asked them to do this, but allows them to do so and appreciates them immensely, he is very fond of them all.  

## Gnomeburg

- Miral Cutterfro (NG rock gnome **commoner**, she/her)
- Larossa ~~Baru~~ Tomenook (CG stout halfling **commoner** or **bard**, she/her)
- 4 Sons:
    - Alston

## Searching

- His Holiness, Bishop Haufren of Saint Cuthbert (LN Oeridian human **war priest**, he/him)
- Provost of the City, Her Prominence Rollei Augustin (LN Suloise human **noble**, she/her)
- The Right Honorable Sir Alfentrask (LG Oeridian half-orc **knight**, they/them)
- Gentlefolk of the Watch (LN/LG/N/NG various **guards**)

The first morning the party wakes in Verbobonc once the cult knows of their presence, they find a finger hanging on their door. Make it the finger of someone they like for extra effect.  
The cult has been putting a trap in motion since becoming aware of the party's presence.  


- Bishop is concerned about the loss of divine powers and cult activity
- Instead of directing them towards the taverns like in the book text, Bishop Haufren suggests the party seek out Virianis Dast. He doesn't explicitly say it, but he suspects that the cult is predominately active among the poor.

> Y: So? Is it true? The Whispered One has returned?  
> O: Yes! We found him out in the hills some days ago, just as prophesized.  
> Y: And?  
> O: And what? Lord ||Vecna|| walks on Oerth again, in all of his terror and glory. He is cruel and fierce. The Serpent whispers to him, and his genius is beyond our comprehension.  
> Y: Incredible. When will I see him?  
> O: Soon, my friend. Soon. The Heart is on her way now, and when she arrives they will carry out the ritual so he may regain his full power. When the time comes, you will be summoned.  
> Y: The Heart is coming to Verbobonc? These are truly benighted times. [Pleased]  
> O: And we will be made greater by them. But now we should go, lie low until the time comes.  
> Y: And the other thing we spoke of?  
> O: I'll make sure it's dealt with.  

## The "Castle"

- TODO

!!! note "Return to Halmadar's Tomb"
    The party may be eager to set out to the Kron Hills in search of Halmadar's Tomb, even if they don't know that this was where the Circle of Eight fell, their research all but certainly points to it as the next step on the archmages' trail. If they attempt to do so, the burial mound is not easy to find. When the Circle of Eight searched for it, the divination blackout was still weak enough in this region that they were able to rely on magic to locate it, a luxury no longer available to the player characters.  

    Instead, they might locate the tomb by other means, such as:

    - Finding and getting the help of the same guide that the Circle of Eight hired to take them into the hills. He might not know exactly where the mound is but might be able to lead the party to where he and the wizards parted ways.
    - Simply setting out into the hills and following Halmadar's trail of destruction back to its source.
    - Being lead there by the gnomes of Osnabrölt, Halmadar's entombment was only 130-some years ago, many of the gnomes there were alive at the time and even participated in its construction. This option is best saved for if the party only think to seek out the tomb after they have gone to Osnabrölt in the later chapter.
    - Or another approach at the DM's discretion.

    See [Book 2, Chapter 1](../vr/1-osnabrolt.md#the-road-to-osnabrolt) for more information on venturing into the Kron Hills.  

    Arriving at the tomb, the party finds the aftermath of the Circle of Eight's investigation of it. Roughly a month has passed since then. Little has changed since [the prologue](0-a-prologue.md), except as described below:  

    1. The stonework is substantially more cracked, and the ceilings are crumbling in places. 
    2. If the Circle cleared the roots from the entranceway, they are still cleared but are beginning to grow back.
    3. The outer seal is open, even if the Circle did not leave it open.
    4. The aftermath of the battle and investigation in the Vaulted Chamber is evident. The spaces where the defeated statues fell are now difficult terrain. If any of the 6 statues did not animate to attack the Circle of Eight, those remaining do now and attack the party. Instead of **stone golems** the remaining statues might be **reduced-threat stone golems** (half the normal hit point maximum and takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs).
    5. **The wretched** living in the bottom of the pit are still there if the Circle did not destroy them.
    6. The inner seal is destroyed, even if the Circle found a way through without destroying it.
    7. In Halmadar's Prison they find the rotting corpses of the Circle of Eight, not necessarily in the exact places they fell. The ones that had their bones turned to jelly by the **Hand of Vecna** are very difficult to identify. The very old ouroboros painted in blood on the floor has been completed with the eye-in-hand symbol of Vecna in much fresher blood. After recovering Halmadar out in the hills, the cultists of Vecna returned here to do this and to loot the bodies. The wizards' most powerful magic items were all stolen, but it is possible that some of the more minor items went unnoticed or ignored. While exploring the room, the party might find that they are not alone. Some ideas for what might be in there with them are:

        - There are still one or more sorrowsworn hidden in the refuse around the room, such as **the lonely**.
        - A **young deep dragon** recently burrowed up into the tomb from below now that the wards have failed, intending to make its lair there, and claim the Circle's remaining items as the beginning of its hoard. It has either hidden itself in the detritus around the chamber or is down in the tunnels below when the party first enter. The adventurers might think to defeat it to claim its hoard, but if they instead parley with it they could gain themselves a useful ally and an opportunity to barter for some of the contents in the hoard

## The Cult Acts

- Once Oaklin has set the party on the path towards the quarry, if he is not accompanying them, after he reports in to the cult leadership, (TODO: Either the Thought or the Heart) summons an **invisible stalker** named Cochort to tail them

### The Rock Powder Inn

Like 6 hours out from Verbobonc on foot? (I dunno, ran it something like that.) -> Because of the rain. Going back the next day with no rain takes closer to 5.  

- Grammo Saxinus (N half-elf **commoner**, he/him)
- Ansrith Saxinus (N wood elf **commoner**, she/they)
- Cylene Saxinus (NG half-elf **commoner**, she/her)
- All three know Elvish, and have Darkvision and Fey Ancestry features. Ansrith also has the Trance feature.

> Young Farmer (speaking somewhat breathlessly): "...along the old Wirthin trail, I found some blood. Big trail of it went off into the wood, it did, toward the pit." (Gulps down more wine.)  
> Old Man: "Eh, how do you know? That trail's nowhere near the old pit!"  
> Young Farmer. "I followed it. I had a good sword with me, an' figured I might find what's been making the trouble. With the rain, there's no telling how long that trail'd last—but when I got up on the ridge, I could see lights down there, moving around. An' I heard screams! That was enough for me, I tell you! I lit out straight for here!"  
> Cylene (Standing beside them): "Oh, Dennis O'Berrin, you're a daring fool! What if something had got you there?" (The young farmer blushes.)  
> Old Man: "Tomorrow we'll get ourselves up there, and we'll see if your words are true."  
> Young Farmer. "What about the militia? I could be to the city by tomorrow...."  
> Old Man: "Nae, the nobles won't be interested in the likes of you. This is a local problem. We don't need no outsiders."  

### Ambush at the Quarry

Like another hour-ish from the inn, with the rain?

- Instead of imp(s), a **quasit** named Zarenival (from Vecna Reborn, TODO: Need to decide who it belongs to. Leaning Oaklin.)
- No Thought at ambush (too high ranked to be there), one or more Memories instead
- Nothics instead of Vampiric Mists

- Disciples of the Verbobonc cell of the Cult of Vecna who fail to embrace the cult's higher mysteries and are transformed into the "Spawn of Vecna" (**nothics**) are smuggled out of town and released into the quarry. They are responsible for the strange noises at night and death of livestock that the locals have reported.

- TODO: Grab encounter from DDB and Discord and write up here. Remember that Nothic HP was cut down to 30 in play because of worry that it would be too hard. Not sure if that was really necessary? Also gave Enchanter *mind sliver* instead of *mending*.

#### Quarry Chase Complications

| d20 | Complication |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Uneven ground or loose stone threatens to slow your progress. Make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to navigate the area. On a failed check, the ground counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain. |
| 2 | A flash of lightning illuminates the area. Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are blinded until the end of your turn. While blinded in this way, your speed is halved. On a successful save, if you are a pursuer, you make your next Wisdom (Perception) check at advantage. |
| 3 | A crash of thunder echoes through the quarry. Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are deafened until the end of your turn. |
| 4 | A sudden drop catches you by surprise. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On a failed save, you fall 1d4 × 5 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen as normal, and land prone. |
| 5 | The ground beneath your feet is slippery with rainwater, mud, or wet gravel. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you fall prone. |
| 6 | There is a boulder in your way. Make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (your choice) to vault over or avoid it. On a failed check, you collide with the boulder and take 1d4 bludgeoning damage. |
| 7 | A gust of wind buffets you. Make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you must use an additional 10 feet of movement to get through the wind. |
| 8 | Wind whips at you from behind. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you fall prone. On a successful save, you may take 10 feet of movement for free. |
| 9 | A bolt of lightning lashes down from the clouds above. If you are 20 or more feet above the floor of the quarry, make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 10 | An orb of ball lightning races towards you. If you are on the ground, make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 11-20 | No complication. |


### Caught Off Guard

Just the nothics?  
Maybe show up as the cultists are dumping another nothic?  

### Aftermath

#### Victory



#### Defeat



## Level Advancement

The characters advance from 6th to 7th level after the events at the quarry, or if they discover the location of the cult while avoiding it entirely.  
Beryn Talkin advances in level, becoming a 6th-level spellcaster. This gives him an additional 3rd level spell slot (for a total of three) and he gains the spell *vampiric touch*. Additionally, he gains the Inescapable Destruction feature, allowing necrotic damage dealt by his cleric spells and Divine Eminence to ignore resistance to necrotic damage.
