# Chapter 6: Vecna Lives


## The Cult Exposed

Living in the temple complex:  

- 1 Thought (**cult fanatic**)
    - Named Vocar (taken from Vecna Reborn)
- 3 Memories (**cult fanatic**)
    - One of them was at the quarry ambush if it occurred. If they escaped that encounter, they are at the temple with the rest. Otherwise, the cell has lost a Memory and has not yet inducted a new one.
- 9 Disciples (**cultists**)
- 4 Bloods (**thugs**)
    - They provide only basic security to the complex and the Scythe and Sheaf, they are not allowed to be involved in other business in the temple aside from specific rituals open to all members.
    - 2 of the Bloods were at the quarry ambush if it occurred. If they escaped that encounter, they are guarding the main floor of the Scythe and Sheaf.
- 3 Spawn (**nothics**)
    - Living in a small cave underneath the complex. All three were transformed in a recent incident with [TODO: Halmadar/The Eye/The Heart of Vecna] and escaped into the cave through the garbage chute. Several Bloods and Fingers were sent in over a few attempts to retrieve them to be released in the quarry outside town with the other Spawn, but all were killed.
- Diraq Malcinex, the Heart of Vecna
    - Arrived only recently
    - Staying in a room of the Scythe and Sheaf
- Halmadar the Cruel, the supposed Voice of Vecna
    - Reminder: Entirely convinced he *is* Vecna, as are the cultists. Referred to only by Vecna's titles, never Halmadar
    - Was found in the hills some days ago by the cultists, as prophesized
    - Does not require rest, instead has been occupying himself in the small shrine room connecting the Memories' quarters to the ritual chamber
- **The Eye**
    - Returned recently with the Rhennee, Yagos smuggled it back into the city. OR. This is a new Eye entirely [TBD]
    - Does not require rest, has been occupying itself in the temple library
- **The Hand**
    - Returned recently with the Rhennee, Yagos smuggled it back into the city. OR. This is a new Hand entirely [TBD]
    - Does not require rest, has been kept locked in a secure room where it will cause minimal damage when not needed
- A handful of **gremishkas** live in the temple, particularly in the library. 

There are more cultists in Verbobonc than just these, but not many, and few of them with the devotion of Disciples or Memories. Committed members who have appearances to keep up in society may live out in the city, not residing in the temple complex. None of the Fingers, including their leader Oaklin, live in the complex. Their skills make them more useful throughout the city, gathering information. A few other Bloods are in the city, living elsewhere simply due to limited space in the temple, or because their services are required elsewhere. Similarly, the Teeth of the cell, such as those who were at the ambush at the quarry, maintain their own lodgings throughout the city.

## Level Advancement

The characters advance from 7th to 8th level after (Except we didn't because there was only one session between the last level up and this one and that might have been too fast? Will be asking the players what they think.)

## Note

- Once the chapter structure of book 2 is finalized, there needs to be a point where the party returns to the temple to search for more information. This is where they'll find the handout about the Book of Inverted Darkness that's in *Vecna Reborn*.
