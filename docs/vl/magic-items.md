# Appendix B: Magic Items

## Holy Symbol of Deceit
*Wonderous item (holy symbol), rarity varies*  

Commonly used by specialist priests tasked with infiltration of other sects or secret cultists hiding their worship, this holy symbol may come in any of the same forms a holy symbol can (amulet, emblem, reliquary) and is imbued with illusory properties. A cleric or paladin can use the holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. As a bonus action, the holy symbol can be made to look like that of a deity or spiritual tradition other than the one it is actually devoted to until another bonus action is used to change or dispel the illusion.  

An observer can attempt to see through the illusion with an Intelligence (Investigation) check. The DC of this check, as well as other limitations on the appearance of the illusion, depend on the item's rarity, as shown in the Holy Symbol of Deceit table.  

#### **Holy Symbol of Deceit**  
Rarity | Limitation | DC
--- | --- | ---
Uncommon | The form of the holy symbol cannot change and it can only be made to look like that of a deity or tradition with similar iconography. For example, an amulet of Iuz that is an uncommon **holy symbol of deceit** that bears the skull icon of Iuz in its true form can be made to appear as an amulet bearing the symbol of Wee Jas or Nerull, both of which are also skulls. | 20
Rare | None. The holy symbol can be made to look like that of any other deity or tradition, but the form of the symbol still cannot be changed. | 25
