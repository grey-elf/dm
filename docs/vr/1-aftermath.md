    - Everyone is happy to have Rona back
    - Rhennee are ritually purifying Yagos' ship with river water
- Shopping
- Back into the temple
    - Watched by guards, ones at side door have been charmed, one inside killed, by Iuzites
    - If they don't go to the temple here, and go in chap 4 instead, there are Vecnan cultists instead

## Visions

Randomly determining dream occurrences:

- Pick a die with a maximum value higher than the party size
- Assign a number to each member of the party, starting from 1
- Roll 2 of the chosen dice when the party take a long rest, each die represents a potential dream contact
    - If the result of either die is the number assigned to a character, that character gets contacted by Vecna in a dream that night
    - If the result of both dice is the same number assigned to a character, that character might get an additionally intense or involved dream scene
- Increase or decrease one or both die sizes to adjust frequency

## Coming To

- If the party went to the Provost and the Watch with the information of the cultists' location, they awaken in a Watch infirmary
- If the party went to Bishop Haufren with the information of the cultists' location, they awaken in an infirmary in the cathedral of St Cuthbert
- Whoever they went to, the other one is now unhappy with them (Bishop or Provost)
- Sir Alfentrask is happy with the party either way, they don't care about the politicking, only the safety of Verbobonc

## News



## A Celebration!

- While the PCs were knocked out after the temple explosion, the powers of Verbobonc were conspiring
- The Viscounty has a history of problems with cults and wants to keep the worry down ahead of word of what happened beneath the Scythe and Sheaf getting out
- The official statement is that there was a cult threat and it has been defeated, and the city is going to make a big show of it having been vanquished
- To celebrate their work in "defeating" the insidious cult taking root in the city, the powers that be are throwing a gala for the heroes
- Characters need to dress fancy
- Two parts:
    - Public awards ceremony
    - More exclusive after-ceremony party
- Awards ceremony:
    - Afternoon
    - Big affair

        - Bishop Haufren
        - Rollei Augustin
        - Probably some sort of representative of the gnomes of the city?
        - His Noble Lordship, the Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc
    - Viscount makes some speech: "I'm sure by now many of you have heard..." "...it is thanks to the strength and quick action of these fine folk that the threat has been vanquished."
    - No mention of Vecna, very strong on point that there is nothing to worry about.
    - Every PC gets a "medal of service to the Viscounty of Verbobonc" and a magic item (OOC choice, IC gift)

    - Just a real schmooze-y rich and fancy type event
    - All NPCs are **nobles** unless they already have other stat blocks
