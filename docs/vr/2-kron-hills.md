> The surrounding hillocks [of Verbobonc] still hold relics of those ancient days, slowly crumbling towers of unsurpassed beauty, troves of buried arrowheads and still-useful armor, and even, it is said, the elven Old Places, sacred refuges hidden in the magical folds of the world. [LGG132]

> The fertile upper reaches of the Kron Hills are home to some twenty thousand gnomes and scattered human farmers and herders. Once claimed by Verbobonc, the northern hills are now a realm unto itself, the so-called Free Assembly of the Kron Hills, ruled by the wise Urthgan the Eldest of Tulvar. The gnomes get on well with all local nonhumans; many gnomes are veterans of the Hateful Wars decades ago, and all are proud of their military traditions. Mineral wealth is plentiful throughout. [LGG145-146]

> It is estimated that nearly 20,000 gnomes live within the region of the Kron Hills. These heights spring eastward from the Lortmils and reach almost to Nyr Dyv. Their verge forms the southern boundary of Veluna, then stretches beside the Velverdyva for a time before peaking in the heart of the Gnarley Forest, where many Sylvan Elves happily roam over their crests. Their southern slopes demark the end of the Wild Coast region and are a part of the northern region of Celene. Some dwarven enclaves exist in the Kron Hills where they butt against the Lortmils, although the number of such demi-humans is not known. The gnomes of the region were instrumental in the organization of the army which drove the humanoid hordes from the Lortmils (and the Kron Hills). They likewise served with honor in the host which defeated the Horde of Elemental Evil in the battle above Verbobonc.  
> The Kron Hills are mined for metals, precious metals, and gems. The upper slopes are quite fertile and grow many crops in sheltered valley and glen. Quite a number of scattered enclaves of humans live in peace with the gnomes and other demi-humans of the area, save in the Gnarley Forest, where the Olvenfolk are isolationist. [WoG49]

### Utreshimon

Following the quelling of the "second rising" of the Temple of Elemental Evil in 579 CY, the village of Nulb has been all but abandoned. Between the abandoned village and the storied town of Hommlet stands an abandoned moathouse. This fortification was once integral to the defense of the region against the Temple's Hordes, but it too has now been abandoned. Seizing upon this opportunity, an **adult blue dragon** named Utreshimon has taken the keep as his new home.  

!!! note "Utreshimon Canon"
    Utreshimon is a character introduced in the 3rd edition adventure *Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil* where he is a young blue dragon that had only made his home in the moathouse about a week before the events of the adventure. The choice here to make Utreshimon an older and somewhat more established dragon is to add a greater threat and additional player into the power dynamics of the Kron Hills.

**Personality Trait.** I’m so pleased with myself and my own good fortune that I can’t stop laughing or chuckling.  
**Ideal.** Humor. Lesser beings exist to be my playthings, and I excel at finding ways to toy with them.  
**Bond.** I feel an obligation to protect the creatures that inhabit my territory (except the ones I eat).  
**Flaw.** Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep.  

Utreshimon tends not to target the intelligent inhabitants of the Kron Hills, knowing that if they and the powers of Verbobonc turned against him he could be driven out of his new home, or worse. At the same time, he is not too happy with the Iuzite activity all over what he considers his domain.
