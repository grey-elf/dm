# Chapter 2: Kron Hills

> The surrounding hillocks [of Verbobonc] still hold relics of those ancient days, slowly crumbling towers of unsurpassed beauty, troves of buried arrowheads and still-useful armor, and even, it is said, the elven Old Places, sacred refuges hidden in the magical folds of the world. [LGG132]

> The fertile upper reaches of the Kron Hills are home to some twenty thousand gnomes and scattered human farmers and herders. Once claimed by Verbobonc, the northern hills are now a realm unto itself, the so-called Free Assembly of the Kron Hills, ruled by the wise Urthgan the Eldest of Tulvar. The gnomes get on well with all local nonhumans; many gnomes are veterans of the Hateful Wars decades ago, and all are proud of their military traditions. Mineral wealth is plentiful throughout. [LGG145-146]

> It is estimated that nearly 20,000 gnomes live within the region of the Kron Hills. These heights spring eastward from the Lortmils and reach almost to Nyr Dyv. Their verge forms the southern boundary of Veluna, then stretches beside the Velverdyva for a time before peaking in the heart of the Gnarley Forest, where many Sylvan Elves happily roam over their crests. Their southern slopes demark the end of the Wild Coast region and are a part of the northern region of Celene. Some dwarven enclaves exist in the Kron Hills where they butt against the Lortmils, although the number of such demi-humans is not known. The gnomes of the region were instrumental in the organization of the army which drove the humanoid hordes from the Lortmils (and the Kron Hills). They likewise served with honor in the host which defeated the Horde of Elemental Evil in the battle above Verbobonc.  
> The Kron Hills are mined for metals, precious metals, and gems. The upper slopes are quite fertile and grow many crops in sheltered valley and glen. Quite a number of scattered enclaves of humans live in peace with the gnomes and other demi-humans of the area, save in the Gnarley Forest, where the Olvenfolk are isolationist. [WoG49]

### Elven Remnants

Before humans came to Verbobonc, the surrounding land was claimed by the elves. The elves spread out into the hills, where they lived and treated with the gnomes of the area. While the elves retreated west into the Gnarley Forest and south into Celene when they chose to cede the land to the arriving humans, many remnants of those days still dot the Kron Hills. Roll a d6 and consult the [Elven Remnant Sites table](#elven-remnant-sites) to determine what the characters encounter.  

Searching near the site of an elven remnant might turn up items from that bygone era, whether left there intentionally or lost in years past. Finding such hidden stashes requires a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Roll a d8 and consult, or choose from, the [Ancient Elven Relics table](#ancient-elven-relics) to determine what the characters' searching uncovers.  

#### Elven Remnant Sites

d6 | Site
--- | ---
1 | An old stone archway of obvious elven design. Any character who passes under it makes Wisdom (Perception) checks with advantage for 1 hour.
2 | The stub of an old stone tower jutting from the top of a hill
3 | A 15-foot-tall stone statue of an elf warrior that has been tipped over on its side
4 | A waist-high, worn stone obelisk marked with elvish writing indicating directions to various settlements that no longer exist, or by ancient elven names that are no longer used
5 | A circle of standing stones within which the air is utterly still, no matter how hard the wind blows outside
6 | An elaborate, abstract statue tops one of the hills nearby
A 50-foot-tall stone statue of an elf warrior with hand raised, palm out, as if to forbid travelers from coming this way


#### Ancient Elven Relics

d8 | Relic
--- | ---
1 | 2d8 arrowheads engraved with intricate patterns
2 | A single slender gauntlet for either the right (50%) or left (50%) hand
3 | A long, slim, single-edged dagger with a slightly curved blade
4 | 1d4 ancient elven gold pieces
5 | 1d6 ancient elven electrum pieces
6 | 1d8 ancient elven silver pieces
7 | 1d10 ancient elven copper pieces
8 | Choose or roll for one item from the Elven Trinkets table in Chapter 2 of *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*

Typical merchants may look at the ancient coinage with some suspicion, but coin is still coin and spends just as well as modern currency. Optionally, a character may be required to make a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) to convince someone to accept the coins, or to make a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to use the coins without drawing question to their provenance. While these coins can still be spent according to their modern equivalences, they may hold even greater value to collectors.  

### Feywild Crossings

While potentially more common in the Gnarley Forest to the east, there are places in the Kron Hills where the border between the Material Plane and the the Feywild is thin, sometimes thin enough for creatures to pass through and roam the hills as they please. Other times this proximity to the Plane of Faerie creates locations suffused with the magic of the fey. Some scholars wonder if this connection to the Feywild was what drew the elves to the region in the distant past, or if the elves were instead responsible for the crossings themselves.  

Roll a d8 and consult the [Fey Crossings Encounters table](#fey-crossings-encounters) table to determine what effect of the Kron Hills' Feywild connection the characters encounter. The "Starting Attitude" column indicates the initial attitude any creatures mentioned in the corresponding entry have towards the characters. Entries that only include creatures assume that the creatures crossed over from the Feywild some time ago and have been going about the hills as they desire, the exact circumstances of these encounters are left up to you.  

#### Fey Crossings Encounters

d8 | Encounter | Starting Attitude
--- | --- | ---
1 | 2d4 **displacer beasts** | Hostile

4 | 1d8 + 1 **sprites** | Indifferent 
5 | 1d6 + 2 **pixies** | Indifferent
6 | A hidden, verdant copse of trees bearing deliciously ripe fruit. Creatures can collect enough fruit to sustain themselves for 1d4 days without requiring any other food or water, but only stays fresh for 1d4 weeks after being picked. The grove is tended by a single **dryad**. | Friendly
7 | A secluded glen within which the air is still and calm and all outside noise sounds distant, creating a calm and restful atmosphere. A creature who finish a short rest in the glen can roll one additional Hit Die and regains hit points equal to the number rolled plus its Constitution modifier, without spending one of its Hit Dice. A creature who finishes a long rest in the glen recovers one additional Hit Die. | —
8 | A large, dead tree near the base of a rocky hill is the lair of a young (yellow or younger) **faerie dragon**. The dragon has hidden collected bits of colored glass in the tree's branches so that at a specific time of day the light will catch them and illuminate the tree and hillside with rainbow hues. As is its nature, the dragon will invisibly prank and tease the characters. After, it will either flee or reveal itself, depending on the reactions it receives. | Friendly

### Iuzite Activity

Deploying out of a major forward operating base established on the edge of the Gnarley Forest (see [Part 1, Chapter 4](../vl/4-traveling.md#iuzite-encampment)), the forces of the Old One have become increasingly active across the Kron Hills.

### Utreshimon

Following the quelling of the "second rising" of the Temple of Elemental Evil in 579 CY, the village of Nulb has been all but abandoned. Between the abandoned village and the storied town of Hommlet stands an abandoned moathouse. This fortification was once integral to the defense of the region against the Temple's Hordes, but it too has now been abandoned. Seizing upon this opportunity, an **adult blue dragon** named Utreshimon has taken the keep as his new home.  

!!! note "Utreshimon Canon"
    Utreshimon is a character introduced in the 3rd edition adventure *Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil* where he is a young blue dragon that had only made his home in the moathouse about a week before the events of the adventure. The choice here to make Utreshimon an older and somewhat more established dragon is to add a greater threat and additional player into the power dynamics of the Kron Hills.

**Personality Trait.** I’m so pleased with myself and my own good fortune that I can’t stop laughing or chuckling.  
**Ideal.** Humor. Lesser beings exist to be my playthings, and I excel at finding ways to toy with them.  
**Bond.** I feel an obligation to protect the creatures that inhabit my territory (except the ones I eat).  
**Flaw.** Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep.  

Utreshimon tends not to target the intelligent inhabitants of the Kron Hills, knowing that if they and the powers of Verbobonc turned against him he could be driven out of his new home, or worse. At the same time, he is not too happy with the Iuzite activity all over what he considers his domain.  

#### Utreshimon Encounters

d6 | Encounter
--- | ---
1-3 | Tracks and Traces
4-5 | Overhead
6 | In the Flesh

##### Tracks and Traces

d6 | Traces
--- | ---
1 | **Prints.** The dirt is marked by large footprints and the furrows of a dragged tail. If Utreshimon has not been seen before, A character can make a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) to determine the size of creature that would leave such prints, while a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Intelligence (Arcana) check will determine that they were left by a dragon specifically. If he has been seen, the characters can easily assume that he left the prints.
2 | **Claw marks.** Deep slashes mark a tree trunk, log, or stone surface. A character can make a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) to determine that the gouges were left by the claws of a massive creature. There is no certain way to tell what the creature is or was, but characters who have seen Utreshimon will likely make assumptions.
3 | **Leveled foliage.** All plant life in a roughly 20 foot radius circle has either been crushed or blasted away. Plants nearer the center of the area are flattened, while ones farther out have been blown outwards, losing leaves, branches, or even being uprooted entirely. 
4 | **Giant elk carcass.**
5 | **Droppings.**
6 | **Dead Iuz troops.**

##### Overhead
