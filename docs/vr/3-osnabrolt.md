**How do I make sure the party hears about "the sacred treasure of Osnabrölt"?**

## The Road to Osnabrölt

> From Living Greyhawk Gazetteer p132:  
> The surrounding hillocks [of Verbobonc] still hold relics of those ancient days, slowly crumbling towers of unsurpassed beauty, troves of buried arrowheads and still-useful armor, and even, it is said, the elven Old Places, sacred refuges hidden in the magical folds of the world.
