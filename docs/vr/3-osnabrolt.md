# Chapter 3: Osnabrölt

**How do I make sure the party hears about "the sacred treasure of Osnabrölt"?**

## Into Osnabrölt

Maldo Daergel-Beren (**gnome scout**)

- Remaining healer: gnome **acolyte**, priest of whole pantheon but primarily Segojan Earthcaller


## Getting Steamed

- During the time it takes the gnomes to prepare for the rituals (ie build the sauna, bathtubs etc.), they can venture to Halmadar's Tomb
- Given stuff to make clothes for themselves while travelling
- Day of fasting beforehand is fine, no mechanical detriment since PCs can go 3+Con (min 1) days without food before exhaustion sets in
- Actual steam room stuff:
    - No items, equipment, etc.
    - Should it be less than 14 hours since it's been established as late fall/early winter? Maybe 10 hours?
    - Just use extreme heat rules: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeHeat
    - At exhaustion 6 from this, not instant death, instead drop to 0 hp and start making death saves (maybe death saves every hour?)
    - Does hallucination only start after one failure?
    - If no failures, hallucination starts anyways after X hours? Don't want characters to miss out
    - Is healing magic allowed? Don't see why not, the goal is to cleanse not to torture and kill the PCs
    - If stabilized, return to level 5 exhaustion?
    - Have to clear this exhaustion afterwards, otherwise the combat later is going to be brutal
        - Clears on short rest like chase exhaustion?
        - Or maybe the gnomes have some sort of "Elixir of Vitality" -> Mini potion of vitality, just clears exhaustion

TODO: Disclaimer/warning about cultural appropriation, saunas, sweat lodges, etc.  

## The Sword of Kas?


## The Enemy

- If Beryn has been travelling with the characters, he legitimately feels bad about this

!!! note "Return to Halmadar's Tomb"
    The party may be eager to set out to the Kron Hills in search of Halmadar's Tomb, even if they don't know that this was where the Circle of Eight fell, their research all but certainly points to it as the next step on the archmages' trail. If they attempt to do so, the burial mound is not easy to find. When the Circle of Eight searched for it, the divination blackout was still weak enough in this region that they were able to rely on magic to locate it, a luxury no longer available to the player characters.  

    Instead, they might locate the tomb by other means, such as:

    - Finding and getting the help of the same guide that the Circle of Eight hired to take them into the hills. He might not know exactly where the mound is but might be able to lead the party to where he and the wizards parted ways.
    - Simply setting out into the hills and following Halmadar's trail of destruction back to its source.
    - Being lead there by the gnomes of Osnabrölt, Halmadar's entombment was only 130-some years ago, many of the gnomes there were alive at the time and even participated in its construction. This option is best saved for if the party only think to seek out the tomb after they have gone to Osnabrölt in the later chapter.
    - Or another approach at the DM's discretion.

    TODO: Need to rewrite most of the above. Circle of Eight found tomb with help of gnomes from Osnabrölt. Oaklin knows where the tomb is since he has been there.

    See [Book 2, Chapter 2](../vr/2-kron-hills.md) for more information on venturing into the Kron Hills.  

    Arriving at the tomb, the party finds the aftermath of the Circle of Eight's investigation of it. Roughly a month has passed since then. Little has changed since [the prologue](../vl/0-a-prologue.md), except as described below:  

    1. The stonework is substantially more cracked, and the ceilings are crumbling in places. 
    2. If the Circle cleared the roots from the entranceway, they are still cleared but are beginning to grow back.
    3. The outer seal is open, even if the Circle did not leave it open.
    4. The aftermath of the battle and investigation in the Vaulted Chamber is evident. The spaces where the defeated statues fell are now difficult terrain. If any of the 6 statues did not animate to attack the Circle of Eight, those remaining do now and attack the party. Instead of **stone golems** the remaining statues might be **reduced-threat stone golems** (half the normal hit point maximum and takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs).
    5. **The wretched** living in the bottom of the pit are still there if the Circle did not destroy them.
    6. The inner seal is destroyed, even if the Circle found a way through without destroying it.
    7. In Halmadar's Prison they find the rotting corpses of the Circle of Eight, not necessarily in the exact places they fell. The ones that had their bones turned to jelly by the **Hand of Vecna** are very difficult to identify. The very old ouroboros painted in blood on the floor has been completed with the eye-in-hand symbol of Vecna in much fresher blood. After recovering Halmadar out in the hills, the cultists of Vecna returned here to do this and to loot the bodies. The wizards' most powerful magic items were all stolen, but it is possible that some of the more minor items went unnoticed or ignored. While exploring the room, the party might find that they are not alone. Some ideas for what might be in there with them are:

        - There are still one or more sorrowsworn hidden in the refuse around the room, such as **the lonely**.
        - A **young deep dragon** recently burrowed up into the tomb from below now that the wards have failed, intending to make its lair there, and claim the Circle's remaining items as the beginning of its hoard. It has either hidden itself in the detritus around the chamber or is down in the tunnels below when the party first enter. The adventurers might think to defeat it to claim its hoard, but if they instead parley with it they could gain themselves a useful ally and an opportunity to barter for some of the contents in the hoard

## Level Advancement

The characters advance from 8th to 9th level after
