# Chapter 4: City of Dread

- returning to Verbobonc from Osnabr√∂lt, cross paths with the Saxinus family heading into the city
- they're getting to safety because of the growing Iuzite activity in the Hills, and because Cylene is very close to due
- near the city, they're attacked by Vecna cultists


Later:

- If the party didn't already find the Book of Vile Darkness handout in the southern part of the cult temple (blocked off by cave-in, accessible by secret door or toilets), they should be encouraged to go back to find it
    - Can remind them that they know that there was that other door of the ritual room that they saw before and haven't gone through when they went back

Should this chapter include getting to Shibboleth and heading out to the Rushmoors?
