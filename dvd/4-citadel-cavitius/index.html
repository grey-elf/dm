<h1 id="chapter-4-citadel-cavitius">Chapter 4: Citadel Cavitius</h1>
<h2 id="special-rules-in-cavitius">Special Rules in Cavitius</h2>
<p>The domain is on lockdown, making some rules stricter than normal  </p>
<ul>
<li>Divine casters feel separated from their gods. Powers still mostly work but are mediated by the Dark Powers with some modifications:</li>
<li>Divination spells of 3rd level or higher fail<ul>
<li>vague whether this is the Powers or an effect similar to the Divination Blackout, surrounding the events transpiring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alignment-detecting magic and abilities only detect law/chaos, not good/evil</li>
<li>All undead have advantage against being turned</li>
<li>Arcane casters:</li>
<li>Divination spells of 5th level or higher fail</li>
<li>No spells or ability allow leaving the plane</li>
<li>Spells that create extradimensional spaces fail</li>
<li>Magic items that create extradimensional spaces still work, but are difficult to use</li>
<li>i.e. can't use bag of holding in battle</li>
<li>Vecna can intercept and answer any spells attempting to contact a being outside of the domain</li>
<li>Summoned creatures don't get to leave</li>
<li>Necromancy spells are twice as effective</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vecnas-domain-in-the-demiplane">Vecna's Domain in the Demiplane</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vecna, and now Iuz in addition, represents more power than the Demiplane of Dread and its Dark Powers are used to containing, which is why some things work differently than normal in Ravenloft</li>
<li>Despite only having been here for a few months from the party's perspective, time weirdness with the Demiplane and the Dark Powers have made it so Cavitius has been here for untold years</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cavitius-the-domain">Cavitius: The Domain</h3>
<ul>
<li>The domain is a vast dust desert and the only settlement is Citadel Cavitius, the only road is the one that leads from the gate of the Citadel to the Burning Peaks</li>
<li>Across the Burning Peaks (through the Mists) is Tovag, the (supposed?) domain of Kas, with which Cavitius is in eternal war</li>
<li>Currently, Vecna has put the Domain on lockdown, the Mists are thick and closed in within view of the Citadel, though are slightly farther out along the road</li>
<li>The main gate of the Citadel is closed and is all but unopenable</li>
<li>Other ways out of the Citadel exist, but not the focus of this adventure</li>
<li>The deserts are wandered/patrolled by <strong>nightwalkers</strong>, out in force because of the lockdown<ul>
<li>No longer life-draining inherently</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Kas</p>
<p>The citizens of Cavitius know of Kas as the traitorous lieutenant of Vecna who betrayed him and led to the destruction of the ancient empire. If asked where he is now they would know that he is ruling a Domain of his own across the mountains, with which they are forever at war with, and invasion forces are regularly sent back and forth across the range. Almost every person in the Citadel has either served in Vecna's army, or has lost family and loved ones to Kas' forces. It is left vague whether Kas is truly ruling his own Domain across the mountains at this point, just as Kas' fate has been left vague for this entire campaign. Maybe the Dark Powers did get him, or some part of him, and put him there, or maybe there's nothing out there at all and it is all part of the Dark Powers' scheme to keep Vecna busy for as long as they could, forming armies out of the Mists to fight Vecna's forces.<br />
However, many also know that Kas, seeking to atone for his betrayal, returned to Vecna's side and now once again wields his mythical sword at Vecna's side, serving him as bodyguard and general as before. This is false, a fact that is only known to Vecna and a very small few of his closest advisors, that "Kas" was some would-be hero that acquired the <em>Sword of Kas (Longsword)</em>, was utterly taken over by its personality and sought to slay Vecna (as the Sword/Kas wants), but had his mind twisted and was transformed into a <strong>death knight</strong>, so he now serves Vecna. See next chapter for more on this false Kas.<br />
The people of Cavitius have no issue holding these two contradicting viewpoints in mind, they will accept whichever of the two is most relevant at any given instant, and cannot be led to see any sort of fault to it.  </p>

<h3 id="citadel-cavitius-city-of-dread">Citadel Cavitius: City of Dread</h3>
<ul>
<li>Outer skull is giant skull made of normal-sized skulls fused together</li>
<li>All structures made of bone-like material</li>
<li>Outdoors lit by magical lamps, only dim light</li>
<li>A vast staircase winds around the inside of the skull to the Temple above the gate, the side of this staircase is wrought to look like a serpent</li>
<li>Banners fly the banner of Vecna's ancient empire: The twisting black ouroboros in the center of a blood-red field</li>
<li>A brutal windstorm whips over the Citadel, preventing flight out the top</li>
<li>Multiple levels of city, blocks out view of the sky in some places</li>
<li>Many roads around the main plaza where the palace is have been barricaded to hold off Iuz's forces</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="people">People</h4>
<p><strong>Mortals.</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>~12000</li>
<li>mostly humans</li>
<li>Most transported here from the last days of Vecna's empire by the Dark Powers</li>
<li>Some travelled here from Oerth as part of the cult, but those are in positions of at least minor authority, not just random people on the streets</li>
<li>Speak Ancient Flan, see below</li>
<li>Tend to be cold and distasteful, but more out for themselves and conniving than bullies (contradicting the book)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Undead.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>~1000 corporeal, intelligent</li>
<li>~1000 incorporeal, intelligent</li>
<li>Uncounted unintelligent undead (basic zombies and skeletons and the like)</li>
<li>Intelligent undead, primarily the corporeal ones, tend to have a higher standing than the mortals of Cavitius, as much a testament to the benefits of immortality as Vecna's favour for them<ul>
<li>Still trying to de-emphasize the undead angle of Vecna to push the secrets stuff more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed "Undead Lords" as power structure from book, but many positions of authority are held by undead beings<ul>
<li>Again, mostly because immortality helps make sure you can keep rising through the ranks</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="language">Language</h4>
<p>The language of Cavitius is Ancient Flan</p>
<ul>
<li>anyone who speaks modern Flan needs to make DC 23 Intelligence (History) or Wisdom (Insight) checks to understand and Charisma (Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation) to be understood</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="coinage">Coinage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Coinage in circulation uses the same cp/sp/gp denominations as the modern Oerth</li>
<li>All coins date back to the Occluded Empire, no new minting</li>
<li>If taken back to Oerth, coins worth 2d100 times face value</li>
<li>Some random smatterings of coins brought from elsewhere: by cultists crossing over, or by travelers within the Demiplane of Dread</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="magic">Magic</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vecna's control over magic (his connection to the Serpent) is so complete that normally all spells fail unless cast by those loyal to Vecna</li>
<li>With Iuz's incursion, his hold on magic has weakened, so casting can work as normal (within the restrictions above)</li>
<li>Normal citizens are still highly distrustful of magic and those who can wield it, or assume they are loyal to Vecna</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cavitius has an army, but it is primarily concerned with the threat of Tovag across the mountains</li>
<li>Internally, order is maintained via two organizations: The police force (colloquially known as "The Hands") and the secret police ("The Eyes")</li>
<li>The two groups are overseen by a <strong>skull lord</strong> commonly known as Lord Haroln, the name of their center head</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hands.</strong><br />
A brutally effective and merciless city guard, the Hands patrol the streets and keep order with threats and violence. The rank and file are made up mostly of recruits from Cavitius, along with cultists from Oerth holding the rank of Blood, and some especially effective Fingers. (Use similar stat blocks as those cult ranks). The force is bolstered when needed (such as now) by unintelligent undead.  </p>
<p><strong>The Eyes.</strong><br />
A clandestine and cutthroat secret police with informants throughout Cavitius. As is befitting the Whispered One, the culture of Cavitius closely follows that of the Cult of Vecna, and the leverage of secrets and blackmail is often the only route to power. The Eyes encourage citizens to turn on each other and report on their neighbours in order to gain favour, and those who do well enough may even get to join the ranks of the secret police officially.<br />
The Eyes are fewer in number than the Hands, but only because they can rely so much on informants and snitches. Those who are fully operatives of the Eyes are Fingers and some Teeth from Oerth, and some truly exceptional natives of Cavitius. The spymasters behind them are more powerful undead, such as <strong>mind drinker vampires.</strong> <strong>The Eye</strong> (the creature, and a different one than the one the heroes last encountered) holds significant power with the surveillance apparatus, however it does not run it, nor is it under the command of the spymasters.  </p>
<p><strong>Lord Haroln.</strong>
A <strong>skull lord</strong> made up of three of Vecna's former councilors and advisors oversee much of what goes on in Citadel Cavitius. The citizenry refer to them collectively as Haroln (when they dare speak their name at all), which is only the name of the center head. The others are Sharl, and Kornast. All three of them were with Vecna at the Siege of Fleeth when he met with the city's representatives, and all three were present at the council meeting seen in the attunement flashback for the <strong>Rapier of Kas</strong>. Whoever is attuned to the Rapier would recognize them as such.<br />
(TODO: Move this to dramatis personae)  </p>
<h4 id="locations-of-note">Locations of Note</h4>
<p><strong>Staircase.</strong> Winding around the entire inside of the Citadel's outer wall is a staircase that leads to the temple over the gate, it is wrought to look like a serpent.</p>
<p><strong>Temple.</strong> From VR, not relevant here, the party won't be going there.</p>
<p><strong>Gate.</strong> Closed.</p>
<p><strong>Haroln's Keep.</strong> The home of Lord Haroln and their personal court, this keep fell to the forces of Iuz and is now being used as a staging point for the rest of the invasion.</p>
<p><strong>The Fortress of the Fingers.</strong> The headquarters of the Hands. Named such for the appearance of the towers.</p>
<p><strong>The Palace of Vecna.</strong> Under siege by Iuz.</p>
<h2 id="welcoming-committee">Welcoming Committee</h2>
<p>TODO: write up for if Beryn isn't with the party.  </p>
<p>Replace encounter with:
- 1x <strong>bloodfray giant</strong>
- 2x <strong>blood witch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replace box text</li>
<li>They have been tasked to watch the entrance from Oerth in case someone who isn't with Iuz comes through</li>
<li>If Beryn is with the party, the witches recognize him</li>
<li>Can be played off as if Beryn has taken the party prisoner, in which case the witches will lead him and the party to Haroln's Keep where the force has made its base<ul>
<li>Might get attacked on the way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If fought, the last surviving witch will surrender and offer the party information and help<ul>
<li>She is more concerned with not dying in this terrible place than staying loyal to Iuz</li>
<li>However she will betray the party and return to the Iuzite side as soon as is convenient</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One of the witches has a <em>ring of tongues</em>, the other has an <em>amulet of comprehending languages</em></li>
</ul>
<p>!!! "Ring of Tongues"
    Magic item, ring, no attunement.<br />
    An Iuzite ring of tongues is made out of one or more tongues taken from dead or captured enemies of Iuz. When worn, it can be activated as an action to cast <em>tongues</em> on the wearer. Activating it requires somehow moistening the tongues, which then dry out over the course of the hour the spell lasts.</p>
<p>!!! "Amulet of Comprehending Languages"
    Magic item, amulet, no attunement.<br />
    An Iuzite amulet of comprehending languages is made out of one or more stitched-together ears taken from dead or captured enemies of Iuz on a piece of cord. When worn, it can he activated as an action to cast <em>comprehend languages</em> on the wearer, but only to translate what the wearer hears.  </p>
<p>If questioned, the giant knows little, but the witches know the following (replacing bullet points in book):</p>
<ul>
<li>Iuz and his forces have been here for 2 or 3 days, it is hard to tell without a daylight cycle (it is obvious to the heroes that time passes differently here than on Oerth)</li>
<li>Iuz is currently on the front lines, laying siege to the Palace of Vecna (which they point out, easily visible: four sleek black towers and a fifth larger one in their center). Once he gets inside and gets to Vecna, he will "consume" the other demigod</li>
<li>Even if he fails to consume Vecna, Iuz is certain that by wielding both the Sword of Kas (which she knows Iuz has from Tycheron) and the Eye of Vecna, he can kill Vecna</li>
<li>Most of Iuz's forces are involved in the siege of the Palace, others are holding the Keep, and a handful are out on the street being disruptive</li>
<li>The natives speak a language that the Iuzites don't know, so Iuz had some of his necromancers prepare the rings and amulets to help</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-to-the-palace">Getting to the Palace</h2>
<h3 id="underground">Underground</h3>
<p>Boring, probably won't even present as an option<br />
But if they do, it's full of nothics instead of ghouls</p>
<h3 id="along-the-streets-across-the-rooftops">Along the Streets / Across the Rooftops</h3>
<p>If across rooftops, modify encounters to balconies, stairwells, etc.</p>
<h4 id="the-doomed">The Doomed</h4>
<p>Same as book except talking is fine, just no touch</p>
<h4 id="the-devoted">The Devoted</h4>
<p>Same as book with new stat blocks:</p>
<p><strong>Memory</strong>: <strong>Priest of Osybus</strong> without soul tattoo abilities<br />
<strong>Bodyguards</strong>: 2 <strong>Disciples of Vecna</strong>
<strong>Reavers</strong>: 4 <strong>Nightveil Specters</strong> initially without mounts</p>
<h4 id="the-demented">The Demented</h4>
<p>Same as book, focus roleplay. "Hands" instead of "Fingers", use 4x <strong>veteran</strong> and 1x <strong>champion</strong></p>
<h4 id="the-desperate">The Desperate</h4>
<p>Same as book, except don't use "Arm of Vecna" as title.<br />
Instead of encountering Haroln themselves as part of this, they encounter a <strong>mind drinker vampire</strong> spymaster from the Eyes.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Calls them out for being outsiders</li>
<li>Admits vampirism</li>
<li>Probably even admits being part of the Eyes</li>
<li>Is there on behalf of Haroln for the same reasons as in the book</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-destroyers">The Destroyers</h4>
<p>Pretty much same as book, reword boxed text so that it's not implied that Iuz knows about the heroes specifically. Also make clear that the kids are fine  </p>
<ul>
<li>Kelleth of Greyhawk: CE, human <strong>Black Gauntlet of Bane</strong>, he/him, knows Beryn well (Beryn was always more of the infiltrator, Kelleth more of a traditional priest of Iuz)</li>
<li>Bear: CE, human <strong>Champion</strong>, she/her</li>
<li>Geral Kher: CE, half-elf <strong>evoker wizard</strong>, they/them</li>
<li>Lanner Hvist: CE, human <strong>blackguard</strong>, he/him</li>
<li>Karhk: CE, <strong>orc war chief</strong>, he/him</li>
<li>Bunch of orcs</li>
</ul>
<p>If reavers get involved (too easy or fight needs to be broken up), they use nightveil specter stats as above</p>
<h4 id="the-drifters">The Drifters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Perceptive members of the party who are familiar with the ways of the Rhennee can spot some familiar markings near an alleyway.</li>
<li>Following these hidden guides lead to finding a hidden group of mostly-humans hiding in an abandoned building that can't be entered except by the marked way.</li>
<li>They, and the home they have set up for themselves, appear similar to Rhennee, except slightly different (and obviously not on boats)</li>
<li>If the word "Rhennee" is used, they claim that it is their word for river, not the name of their people</li>
<li>They are Vistani, nomads/wanderers of the Mists/Demiplane of Dread</li>
<li>The Vistani are immediately extremely apprehensive and border on hostility, but can be put at ease with the party's familiarity with Rhennee culture</li>
<li>This (smallish) group of Vistani where travelling through the domain when it became too dangerous to leave, and have been hiding out here for a couple days now</li>
<li>They represent a safe place to stay and a source of non-Vecnan or Iuzite information within the city</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all just part of my headcanon that the Rhennee are an offshoot of the Vistani that got stranded on Oerth.  </p></div>
