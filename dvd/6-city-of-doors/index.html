<ul>
<li>Ward around the Armory stopping anyone from approaching</li>
<li>There is a perimeter of dead bodies surrounding the structure and anyone who gets too close is struck down (see Area 1 in next chapter)</li>
<li>Several two-foot orbs of darkness fly around the structure</li>
<li>The longer Vecna remains (already been some days) the more he destabilizes Sigil</li>
<li>The Lady could lower the wards on the city to allow divine intervention to remove Vecna, but that would also destroy Sigil</li>
<li>Not sure if I agree with the Lady having a "true form" that she could reveal?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="watch-and-wait">Watch and Wait</h3>
<ul>
<li>Notice the dark orbs flying around and eating holes through the corpses that fell to the perimeter</li>
<li>Observe the surge and withdrawal of the army as individuals or small groups test the wards<ul>
<li>some are chased off by the spheres</li>
<li>others stop before the perimeter and try, but fail, to dispell it</li>
<li>yet others fall to the death field</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe see one group successfully get through, because they have converted (note next section)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-messenger-from-vecna">A Messenger from Vecna</h3>
<ul>
<li>Already made when the heroes arrive, or made afterwards at an appropriate time. Whatever fits better</li>
<li>Slaad emerges from the smoke but stays within the death field</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>”Hear the holy prophecy of Vecna, Supreme Deity of
All the Infinite Spaces and Every Space Between. Says
the Lord: You cannot and will not reach me with
malice in your heart; I will not allow it. I know your
thoughts as you think them, for I am become a true
god. Yet my power now is nothing to that which I am
soon to reach, when I reach forth from the very center
of multiversal disintegration and reorder the cosmos,
according to my whims, from first to last dimension.
Those who stand against me will be wiped from exis-
tence, as if they had never been. But those who now
forswear past allegiance and pledge themselves to the
one supreme lord of creation may be brought into the
new world. Decide soon, for reality rapidly speeds
toward dissolution and my ultimate ascension.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Slaad stays around to judge reaction</li>
<li>Murmuring throughout the crowd, that grows in intensity to arguments</li>
<li>Clear that some are considering turning to the other side<ul>
<li>Those who do have already been seen successfully passing through into the building</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone maybe takes a potshot at the Slaad, kicking off a bunch more of ranged attacks at it until it either dies<ul>
<li>It does not flee, confident that Vecna will protect it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approaching-the-lady">Approaching the Lady</h3>
<ul>
<li>Despite the art, while she is given a wide berth, she is on the edge of the army, but not near where the heroes approach from so they have to go through (or over) the camp to get to her </li>
<li>Despite the art, she's as big as she usually is</li>
<li>When any hero with an artifact of Vecna or a Sword of Kas gets within 40 ft of the Lady, she moves for the first time since Vecna took over the Armory</li>
<li>She turns to the hero(es) in question. As always she does not speak but it's obvious that she's examining them</li>
<li>Nothing happens for a beat</li>
<li>Then the Dabuses surround the party and start to rebus at them</li>
<li>Potentially require Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) checks per sentence. But also this can't proceed until the party gets it so there's not really a point to that?<ul>
<li>Maybe allow for some misunderstanding, or for good rolls to get extra context</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know the shape of things to come, yet this I did not see.</p>
<p>Beyond even the devices of the Whispered One, salvation is offered.</p>
<p>The Serpent’s protege may yet be stopped and removed from this place that is profane for any god to tread.</p>
<p>You are the first, last, and only hope.</p>
<p>Only you may stand against this god, you who are bound to the splintered dagger to his heart.</p>
<p>Vecna’s death ward around the Armory will not stop you, nor can his divine energies burn you.</p>
<p>If the warp and weft of the cosmos you wish to preserve, make all haste; remove Vecna from this place.</p>
<p>It may be that you will succeed."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Once the message is across, she turns her focus (and perhaps power?) back towards the Armory and pays them no more direct attention</li>
<li>Dabuses will fight if provoked. Make them way stronger than the 5e stats for them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-the-army">In the Army</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The torus' nature is such that it cannot abide coexistence with point-source divine energy."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Looks uniform from a distance, but, once the heroes are in it, it becomes more like small clumps and bunches<ul>
<li>Probably a big, obvious, well-ordered Harmonium section</li>
<li>Remember the Faction War just happened, so very low faction representation in an organized manner otherwise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Big tent city vibes</li>
<li>Some much nicer than others, some groups much more armed than others</li>
<li>Most are waiting for the Lady to signal for an attack, others are planning their own moves</li>
<li>Play up Planescape diversity and strangeness</li>
<li>It may take some time, but the heroes could find representatives of any race, world, or religious group in the crowd</li>
<li>Lots of merchants trying to squeeze as much jink out of the situation as they can, just in case they survive this</li>
<li>Party likely easily marked as Clueless, but can find people willing to answer simple questions about Sigil, or about events since Vecna arrived<ul>
<li>Otherwise aren't paid much mind unless they decide to present or use the Hand or Eye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even the Swords don't get much attention, because in their splintered state they avoid recognition by most</li>
<li>Revealing the Swords to a group gets unimpressed responses<ul>
<li>Probably they're far from the first to claim they have the Sword of Kas since Vecna appeared</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting rid of Ronnasic entirely, instead we have...</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="shemeshka">Shemeshka</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sometime after speaking with the Lady, or after spending enough time in the Army and drawing some attention, the heroes pick up a tail</li>
<li>A tiefling agent of Shemeshka is following them, gathering intel and waiting for the go-ahead to invite them to meet the King of the Cross-Trade</li>
<li>The tail can be spotted with sufficient perceptive skills (passive or roll, whatever feels right)</li>
<li>Shemeshka is in a very elaborate tent on a raised wooden platform off the cobbles of the plaza, relatively near the inner edge of the encampment</li>
<li>The platform keeps the area around her tent clear</li>
<li>All the surrounding tents, likely a few rings out, are her agents'. Some obviously some not</li>
<li>Party is brought to sit at a table under an awning out of the front of the tent, and wait for her</li>
<li>They can hear her inside getting ready, maybe catch a glimpse of her in the mirror as she approaches</li>
<li>She's here for exposition, have her trade secrets and make sure the party are clear on important things</li>
<li>Most relevant: The power of belief, and how Vecna used it to cripple the Sword of Kas<ul>
<li>She shouldn't completely spell it out for them, but guide them to the conclusion. Unless it becomes necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second most relevant: With the Swords, they can get through the barrier, and probably take a few others with them as well<ul>
<li>They should know this from the Lady already, but just in case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She wants the Book of Vile Darkness, and makes it extremely clear, threatens violence if needed</li>
<li>She won't sully herself with the Hand, Eye, or Sword(s)</li>
<li>Also offers safe long rest if they cooperate</li>
<li>At some point shuts down the entire conversation to watch and laugh as Autochon tries and fails to attack the ward<ul>
<li>This replaces any other Autochon encounter</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approaching-the-armory">Approaching the Armory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Same as book, minus Autochon</li>
<li>Bulk in next chapter</li>
<li>19th level!</li>
