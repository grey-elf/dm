<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Modified Box Text</p>
<p>Tiles of pure light pave the floor and walls of this heavenly chapel. Pews of silver march toward the front of the chapel, where stands an altar of rose-hued crystal in front of an oddly curved wall. Several figures sit in pews, and behind the altar, a large man in robes ministers to the assembled. Statuelike figures stand on balconies to the far left and right of the altar, resembling giant humanoids in robes. One has a massive eye that has taken over the rest of its head, and the other's face is melted by the hand-shaped brand burned into its skin.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="area-description">Area Description</h2>
<p><strong>Ceiling.</strong> The ceiling is 50 ft. high overhead</p>
<p><strong>Balconies.</strong> Two balconies sit on either side of the back wall of the room, each is 30 ft. above the ground. There are stairs leading to each from either side of the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Pews.</strong> Moving through the pews parallel to them is normal, movement perpendicular to them is difficult terrain.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-confrontation">The Final Confrontation</h2>
<p>Characters enter as Ely Cromlich is giving a sermon to 5 <strong>disciples of Vecna</strong> and a <strong>green slaad</strong>, while <strong>the Eye</strong> and <strong>the Hand</strong> watch from the balconies. Vecna himself is nowhere to be seen.  </p>
<p>Ely continues his sermon unless interrupted by the party or Vecna. Vecna will interrupt and make himself seen, by turning the curved walls behind the altar transparent, once the hero with the True Sword of Kas enters the room.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Modified Box Text</p>
<p>The convex bulges of the wall behind the altar fades from opacity to transparency, revealing a massive cavity lined with hundreds of small statuettes. Within the cavity is a titanic humanoid, limned in brilliance. Its left eye and left hand have both been replaced by divine energy, glowing and golden.It is clear that this being has achieved godhood!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The True Sword of Kas.</strong> In the presence of Vecna, the True Sword of Kas will fully awaken at this time. Whoever of the heroes next grasps and draws it, will become immediately attuned.  </p>
<h3 id="vecna">Vecna</h3>
<p><strong>Stat block.</strong> Modified from <strong>Vecna the Archlich</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Vecna is divine but most of his focus is on resisting his ejection from Sigil so he cannot turn his full power on the party</li>
<li>In his empowered state, Vecna is Gargantuan (4x4 grid) until phase 3. While this size, the reach of his melee attacks is increased to 20 ft.</li>
<li>Damage from the True Sword of Kas reduces Vecna's max HP by the amount instead</li>
<li>Vecna has fitted himself with golden replacements for his hand and eye, which his new disciples are now matching</li>
<li>Vecna cannot magically sense his Hand and Eye, but once they are in his presence he can locate them by their absence, even if in a container</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h3>
<p>Vecna orders his followers to kill the heroes, while he keeps what focus he has on accelerating his reformation of the multiverse, keeping his attention on the array of colored relics around him. His ability to triangulate the location of his Hand and Eye by their absence leads to him telling his followers to focus on the hero(s) that have them, since reincorporating the missing parts of his body will further increase his power.  </p>
<p>Despite his distraction, Vecna will use each of his turns to resurrect one of his followers in the following order of priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ely Cromlich</li>
<li>The Eye</li>
<li>The Hand</li>
<li>Any one Disciple of Vecna</li>
<li>The green slaad</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Barrier.</strong> The curved wall has become transparent, but it is still a barrier. Nothing other than the True Sword of Kas can pierce it.  </p>
<p><strong>Ending the phase.</strong> If the barrier is struck by the True Sword of Kas, it shatters and Phase 2 begins. If at any time all of Vecna's minions in the room are dead, Phase 2 also begins.  </p>
<h3 id="phase-2">Phase 2</h3>
<p>Now that the threat is significantly more urgent, Vecna joins the fray. Any surviving followers of Vecna continue to fight, but will no longer be resurrected. With his attention turned towards fighting the heroes, the Lady of Pain is able to take a more active role in removing him from her city.  </p>
<p><strong>Mazed.</strong> At the end of each of Vecna's turns during this phase, the Lady of Pain is able to act. She uses her absolute power over the material reality of Sigil to extract the temple and warp it into a Maze around Vecna and the heroes. The Mazes are still part of Sigil, so she cannot keep him contained in there forever, but temporarily it will help cut him off from his worshippers and make him more vulnerable to defeat at the heroes' hands.  </p>
<p>After Vecna's first turn during this phase, the temple is lifted out of the ground and up to the surface of Sigil where the army is gathered (switch to Armory Maze map). Then on each subsequent round after Vecna's turn, features of the room disappear as the Lady folds it into a Maze. Typically she is able to create a Maze faster than anyone is capable of noticing, but in this case she is still fighting against Vecna's divine powers. The features of the room disappear in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>The pews and altar.</li>
<li>The balconies and stairs. Any creatures on them fall to the ground below.</li>
<li>All of the room except for the recessed dais where Vecna started the encounter. Any creature other than the heroes and Vecna still in the rest of the room when this happens vanish, they will be dealt with by the Lady and the people of Sigil. Vecna and the heroes are transported to the remaining platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>During this phase, if Vecna is reduced to 0 hit points he will retreat to the dais and reform the barrier as he tries to regain some strength to finish the heroes off.</p>
<p><strong>Ending the phase.</strong> This phase ends once the Lady has finished mazing Vecna and the party. As such, this phase ends after Vecna has taken four turns. (Reduce frequency for greater challenge).  </p>
<h3 id="phase-3">Phase 3</h3>
<p>Vecna's maximum and current hit points reset, his size is reduced to Medium and his reach is reset to 5 ft. His spells are not reset. It's time to finish him off.  </p>
<p>Vecna gets an additional turn at the beginning of this phase, otherwise all the heroes would get to go before him when he's the only available target for them. We still want there to be some challenge.  </p>
<p><strong>Ending the phase.</strong> There are only two ways this can end: The heroes are victorious, or are defeated by Vecna.</p>
