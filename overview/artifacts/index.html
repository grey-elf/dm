<h3 id="greatsword">Greatsword</h3>
<p>Location: Osnabr√∂lt  </p>
<p>Aspect: The Destroyer, Kas as warrior and bodyguard. Brutal, bloodthirsty, ferocious.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Attunement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are Kas, the Destroyer. When you are not at Lord Vecna's side protecting his life with your own, you are the tip of his spear, leading the charge of his dread hordes and war wizards against his enemies. Fear grips even the mightiest heroes of Good when you step onto the battlefield, for they know that the approach of Lord Vecna's champion is the approach of death itself. His gift to you, the greatsword in your hands, is an instrument of glorious destruction: it sails through the air with grace and ease, and turns everything around you into bloody carnage.<br />
The siege of Fleeth drags on ever longer, too long. This is not the first assault you have lead against the ancient city's high, gleaming walls and it won't be the last, but this time is no ordinary attack. Displeased by the lack of progress made in capturing his former home, Lord Vecna himself, along with a cadre of his most powerful arcanists, intends to breach those legendary walls. He will reveal to the Fleethans the power of The Serpent, you, and the forces surrounding you on the field of battle, must get him there.<br />
With a spray of gore, your blade cleaves through the abdomen of a Fleethan templar. His blood paints the stark white armour of the other two champions with a splash of scarlet as they bring their blades down on you.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> On the battle-wrought plains outside the walls of the long-besieged city of Fleeth, the suns in the sky are blotted out by dark magic. As Vecna's army engages Fleeth's defenders all around, <strong>Kas the Destroyer</strong> faces down two <strong>champions</strong> anointed by the church of Pholtus which holds sway within the city.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having dispatched Fleeth's most zealous and formidable warriors, you turn back to your master. The Undying King watches impassively from the low ridge you leapt from to intercept the templars, refusing to even lift a finger against the feeble attacks made against him by Fleeth's defenders. His entourage of sorcerers guard him from attacks at range, and your duty as always is to ensure that no one gets close enough to attempt anything more. As you return to your place at his right you scan the battlefield around you. Conscripted soldiers, alive and undead, clash with the city's defenders while battle mages rain fire and poison onto them from afar. The winds blowing across the plain carry with them the smells of magic and death, and whip the Whispered One's robes around his skeletal body.<br />
At Lord Vecna's side stands Acererak, his longest-serving and most successful apprentice. You meet the cambion's hard stare, it is no secret amongst the inner circle that the two of you are often at odds.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Kas, Vecna, and Acererak discuss how to make the final approach to the city walls. Kas and Acererak do not get on well. Acererak believes that Kas is beneath him and undeserving of his station, meanwhile Kas is jealous of Vecna's favour for Acererak. Acererak has been in Vecna's tutalage since the cambion was 10, decades ago. Kas was never able to remove him from the equation, like he did with Narek, Vecna's previous apprentice and Kas' own son, and it has since become too late. The events with Narek occurred some time before Acererak's apprenticeship began. Acererak is a cambion <strong>archmage</strong> (TODO: throw together some stats for this).<br />
During the deliberations, a beam of radiance lances from the walls of Fleeth, targeting Vecna. It comes from Vecna's left, so from his right, Kas isn't in a position to react fast enough. Acererak is on the left, and attempts to conjure a magical barrier to protect himself and Vecna, but allows Vecna's left side to be caught in the beam. Vecna goes down, Acererak is unharmed. Acererak carries Vecna to safety after Vecna weakly orders Kas to kill those responsible.  </p>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Kas' supernatural abilities allow him to quickly close the distance to the walls of Fleeth and reach the top, whether by climbing or shapeshifting. He knows where the beam came from and is able to track the priests as they move along the battlements. Atop the walls, Kas battles three Pholtan <strong>war priests</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</li>

<li>Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Any normal sword made to such proportions would be virtually unmanageable by a human, but the magical endowments of the Sword of Kas allow it to be handled by any warrior with grace and ease, albeit with two hands.<br />

<p>Location: In the possession of the false Kas  </p>
<p>Aspect: The Bloody Handed, Kas as warlord and general. Remorseless, severe, unyielding.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are Kas, the Bloody Handed. As grand general of Lord Vecna's armies, you direct an unrelenting force of oppression and conquest that bathes the land with blood in the Whispered One's name, you order them as an extension of the Whispered One's will. The well-regimented legions of slaves, soldiers, war wizards, and untold undead are at your command, waging devastating campaigns of war.
