<p>It is unclear how much of the personality is that of the Sword's own and how much is Kas'. It is probably a mix of both as they bled into each other over Kas' time wielding it, and then mixed more thoroughly when Kas was destroyed and when the Sword was split.  </p>
<h3 id="greatsword">Greatsword</h3>
<p>Location: Osnabr√∂lt  </p>
<p>Aspect: The Destroyer, Kas as warrior and bodyguard. Brutal, bloodthirsty, ferocious.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Attunement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are Kas, Kas the Destroyer. When you are not at Lord Vecna's side protecting his life with your own, you are the tip of his spear, leading the charge of his dread hordes and war wizards against his enemies. Fear grips even the mightiest heroes of Good when you step onto the battlefield, for they know that the approach of Lord Vecna's champion is the approach of death itself. His gift to you, the greatsword in your hands, is an instrument of glorious destruction: it sails through the air with grace and ease, and turns everything around you into bloody carnage.<br />
The siege of Fleeth drags on ever longer, too long. This is not the first assault you have lead against the ancient city's high, gleaming walls and it won't be the last, but this time is no ordinary attack. Displeased by the lack of progress made in capturing his former home, Lord Vecna himself, along with a cadre of his most powerful arcanists, intends to breach those legendary walls. He will reveal to the Fleethans the power of The Serpent, you, and the forces surrounding you on the field of battle, must get him there.<br />
With a spray of gore, your blade cleaves through the abdomen of a Fleethan templar. His blood paints the stark white armour of the other two champions with a splash of scarlet as they bring their blades down on you.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> On the battle-wrought plains outside the walls of the long-besieged city of Fleeth, the sun above is blotted out by dark magic. As Vecna's army engages Fleeth's defenders all around, <strong>Kas the Destroyer</strong> faces down two <strong>champions</strong> anointed by the church of Pholtus which holds sway within the city.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having dispatched Fleeth's most zealous and formidable warriors, you turn back to your master. The Undying King watches impassively from the low ridge you leapt from to intercept the templars, refusing to even lift a finger against the feeble attacks made against him by Fleeth's defenders. His entourage of sorcerers guard him from attacks at range, and your duty as always is to ensure that no one gets close enough to attempt anything more. As you return to your place at his right you scan the battlefield around you. Conscripted soldiers, alive and undead, clash with the city's defenders while battle mages rain fire and poison onto them from afar. The winds blowing across the plain carry with them the smells of magic and death, and whip the Whispered One's robes around his skeletal body.<br />
At Lord Vecna's side stands Acererak, his longest-serving and most successful apprentice. You meet the cambion's hard stare, it is no secret amongst the inner circle that the two of you are often at odds.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Kas, Vecna, and Acererak discuss how to make the final approach to the city walls. Kas and Acererak do not get on well. Acererak believes that Kas is beneath him and undeserving of his station, meanwhile Kas is jealous of Vecna's favour for Acererak. Acererak has been in Vecna's tutalage since the cambion was 10, decades ago. Kas was never able to remove him from the equation, like he did with Narek, Vecna's previous apprentice and Kas' own son, and it has since become too late. The events with Narek occurred some time before Acererak's apprenticeship began. Acererak is a cambion <strong>archmage</strong> (TODO: throw together some stats for this).<br />
During the deliberations, a beam of radiance lances from the walls of Fleeth, targeting Vecna. It comes from Vecna's left, so from his right, Kas isn't in a position to react fast enough. Acererak is on the left, and attempts to conjure a magical barrier to protect himself and Vecna, but allows Vecna's left side to be caught in the beam. Vecna goes down, Acererak is unharmed. Acererak carries Vecna to safety after Vecna weakly orders Kas to kill those responsible.  </p>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Kas' supernatural abilities allow him to quickly close the distance to the walls of Fleeth and reach the top, whether by climbing or shapeshifting. He knows where the beam came from and is able to track the priests as they move along the battlements. Atop the walls, Kas battles three Pholtan <strong>war priests</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Any normal sword made to such proportions would be virtually unmanageable by a human, but the magical endowments of the Sword of Kas allow it to be handled by any warrior with grace and ease, albeit with two hands.<br />

<p class="admonition-title">Attunement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are Kas, the Bloody Handed. As grand general of Lord Vecna's armies, you direct an unrelenting force of oppression and conquest that bathes the land with blood in the Whispered One's name, you order them as an extension of the Undying King's will. The well-regimented legions of slaves, soldiers, war wizards, and untold undead are at your command, waging devastating campaigns of war. Entire cities are razed, others are enslaved either for service or experimentation. No sacrifice is too great, those that fall will simply serve again in another form. His gift to you, the longsword at your side, is the emblem of your rank: representing the authority you have over thousands of blades without ever drawing your own.<br />
Gone now are the days of conquest you so enjoyed, the borders of the Occluded Empire in a state of stagnation ever since the grand campaign against Fleeth and the siege that ended it. Vecna's ambitions have turned elsewhere, immersing himself in works beyond your understanding and leaving the Empire's vast armies to wither and atrophy. Your tactical acumen and the military might it drives feel wasted on squashing puny uprisings of unwary rebels and dissidents.<br />
But recent news from the south have brought you here, around a table of maps with your most trusted generals, and a feeling that may soon change. An alliance of formerly-squabbling factions descended from refugees of the destruction of Suel, now having claimed the much of valley in the southwest from the native Flannae tribes, have been gathering forces. They have already struck north across the Empire's border several times, capturing supplies from transport caravans, and the diviners now say that they are planning a more significant offensive.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Military planning. The proto-Keolandish forces have been very effective against undead troops protecting the caravans, and they are extremely familiar with the terrain. The Empire's war wizards and trained troops are spread thin, and haven't seen serious combat in years.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> One of the generals questions if Vecna has been informed of this development. Kas feels like he does not need to know, he can do this himself. Some influence from the Sword. Can pass it off as "he doesn't need to be bothered with this."  </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor Beneficial: While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast <em>shield</em> with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1‚Äì5, you can‚Äôt cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
<li>Major Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.</li>
<li>Minor Detrimental: While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed.</li>
<li>Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact.</li>
</ul>
<p>War council meeting (make clearly different than Rapier scene), planning on responses to an alliance of forces in the Sheldomar Valley (who would eventually become Keoland) amassing forces for a push north into the Empire's territory, focused around Niole Dra.  </p>
<h3 id="shortsword">Shortsword</h3>
<p>Location: First seen in the possession of Iuz, recovered from the ruins of Tycheron.  </p>
<p>Aspect: The Hateful, Kas as torturer and assassin. Cruel, sadistic, vicious.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Attunement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are Kas, the Hateful. Pain is your purpose, and you exercise it with delight against the enemies of your Lord Vecna. At times you are his torturer, whether twisting the flesh and minds of those who think they can hold secrets unknown to the Whispered One himself, or turning their agony to shatter and terrify their loved ones. Other times you are his assassin, plucking off figures of power and influence in the places they think themselves most safe, either making of them grizzly displays of the Undying King's wrath or ending them without the slightest hint as to who may be responsible. His gift to you, the blade in your hand, is an instrument of death: to be used as he wills it.
But now you stalk through the Tower of Ykrath, its soaring height extending from the surface of a lake the bottom of which is unknown. This is where your master has sequestered himself for years, leaving you to manage every possible matter of state in his absence. You don't even know what you're doing here or how you got here, so lost were you in your own thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Kas is about to turn here. He's going to continue up this tower and try to kill Vecna. What's on his mind?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spray of blood follows your blade as you draw it back out of the body falling to the floor. Two others dressed the same back away, looks of confused recognition disappearing along with the life of their companion. One tries to call for aid, but you know this study is shielded from noise. The other tries to ready some spell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Kas kills some of Vecna's apprentices. (Potentially these three become the <strong>deathlock wights</strong> in 2.5) </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, you gain proficiency in the stealth skill.</li>
<li>Major Beneficial: While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast <em>hold monster</em> with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1‚Äì5, you can‚Äôt cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
<li>Minor Detrimental: While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed.</li>
<li>Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rapier">Rapier</h3>
<p>Location: The ruins of the Rotted Tower  </p>
<p>Aspect: The Terrible, Kas as advisor and chancellor. Tyrannical, ruthless, paranoid.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Attunement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are Kas, the Terrible. For centuries you have had Lord Vecna's ear as his most trusted advisor, and the foremost among his barons. A chill is sent through even the most cunning negotiators and unflinching monarchs by your very word, for they know that the voice of Lord Vecna's regent is the voice of authority itself. His gift to you, the rapier on your hip, is a symbol of absolute dominion: it brings any dispute to an end, often without the need to draw the blade.<br />
The palace complex is surrounded by the grim sprawl of Cavitius, miles and miles of streets that you rarely walk upon in recent days. Instead, most of your time is spent within the palace proper. Day after day, you are worn down by matters of state, left to you by Vecna as he ever more regularly abdicates from his duties as ruler. The grand windows of the council chamber look out across the sea of rooftops, out towards the great lake, and to the Tower of Ykrath rising from its surface. Even now, Vecna sequesters himself there, ignoring the Empire he forged to instead delve into arcane secrets you could not begin to understand. On a raised dais, you sit at the ringed council table, in a seat that the Undying King has taken fewer than ten times since the return from the campaign against Fleeth, now several years past. Two empty seats flank you: the one on your right reserved for yourself to take whenever Vecna deigns to grant his attentions to the apparatus that keeps his vast nation running, and the one on your left intended for Acererak. It has been some time since you have seen the cambion also, ever since he departed to begin some grand project of his to the East. His continued absence more of a boon in your mind.<br />
As your dark gaze rests on the impossible tower out in the water, your thoughts hone in on Vecna's negligence, and you tighten your hold on the grip of your sword. "Kas." The firm address from one of the Barons snaps your attention back to the proceedings.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Sharl (NE Flan human <strong>noble</strong>, he/him) did not offer the proper obeisance when addressing Kas. Kas' customary title is "Lord", even among the Barons, and while heading the council in Vecna's place it is "Chancellor".  </p>
<p>Unlike the Greatsword attunement, this one is a bit more freeform, since it is not combat-based. Mix these encounters together and flow them into each other as needed.  </p>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Acererak has requested an additional 10,000 undead be sent to him for use in his current work. With the Empire no longer on a campaign of conquest in recent years, that is a significant number of the ready reserves.  </p>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> The secret police have been tipped off to a revolt brewing in the Northwestern territory, a decision must be made about what is to be done about it.  </p>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> There is a significant food shortage in the Eastern territories.  </p>
<p><strong>Encounter.</strong> Kas feels as if his authority is being called into question by one or more of the Barons. Whether this is true is unclear, but Kas believes it in his paranoia.  </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, you can‚Äôt be charmed or frightened.</li>
<li>Major Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.</li>
<li>Minor Detrimental: While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed.</li>
<li>Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Described like the image on VL75, but without the wavy blade or unicorn horns. The one in VL is a claymore, mixing both definitions for some reason.)</p>
<h2 id="the-true-sword-of-kas">The True Sword of Kas</h2>
<p>Sword type (longsword, shortsword, rapier, or greatsword) is selected when the four swords are reunited.  </p>
<p>Aspect: The Betrayer.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are Kas. Kas the Destroyer. Kas the Bloody Handed. Kas the Hateful. Kas the Terrible. You are Kas of Tycheron. You are Kas the Betrayer. Nothing else you have ever done will be remembered. History will know you only as the man who struck down the greatest villain the world ever knew, despite it being nothing more than an act of greed. A cautionary tale that evil is so often its own undoing.<br />
You are not Kas. The sword in your hand is the symbol of Vecna's folly, his gift to his champion that proved to be their mutual undoing. You are not Kas but you wield his weapon, and in this moment your goals are simple and aligned: <strong>Die, Vecna. Die!</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas, to act as his right hand. This despicable villain served as champion, chancellor, general, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna‚Äôs admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. In life, the stories of Kas earned him many titles: The Destroyer, the Bloody-Handed, the Hateful, the Terrible. But in his death and the ages since, he has been remembered by one title above all others: The Betrayer.  </p>
<p>For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich, but as Kas‚Äôs power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich‚Äôs empire in Vecna‚Äôs stead. Legend says Vecna‚Äôs destruction came at Kas‚Äôs hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant‚Äôs doom, leaving only Kas‚Äôs sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.  </p>
<p>The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.  </p>
<p>If the sword isn‚Äôt bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 4d10 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword‚Äôs demand is met.  </p>
<p><strong>Special Properties.</strong> The True Sword of Kas has the following special properties:  </p>
<ul>
<li>While attuned to the artifact, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</li>
<li>While attuned to the artifact, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
<li>While attuned to the artifact, you gain proficiency in the stealth skill.</li>
<li>While attuned to the artifact, you can‚Äôt be charmed or frightened.</li>
<li>While attuned to the artifact, your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.</li>
<li>While attuned to the artifact, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.</li>
<li>While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast shield with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1‚Äì5, you can‚Äôt cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
<li>While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast hold monster with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1‚Äì5, you can‚Äôt cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
<li>While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spirit of Kas.</strong> While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.  </p>
<p><strong>Spells.</strong> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can‚Äôt cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.  </p>
<p><strong>Sentience.</strong> The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  </p>
<p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common.  </p>
<p><strong>Personality.</strong> The sword‚Äôs purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna‚Äôs worshipers, destroying the lich‚Äôs works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.  </p>
<p>The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword‚Äôs obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.  </p></div>
