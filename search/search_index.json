With his name struck from the memory of the Oerth, the Cult of Vecna is never referred to as such. Instead, it is normally called the Cult of the Whispered One by the few who even know it exists. Individual cells of the cult use names such as the following: Followers of the Whispered One Disciples of the Hand and the Eye Maimed God's Chosen Servants of the Spider Throne Until the adventure's beginning, the cult had been biding their time and spreading their reach, but had been mostly kept in check by the Spurned Cult of Iuz, their chief rivals. Still, their prophecies forewarned their lord's return in this year, and they had been making preparations. Further details on Vecna's plan can be found in the Story Overview No matter how powerful a being is, there exists a secret that can destroy him. In every heart is a seed of darkness hidden from all others; find that evil seed, and your enemies are undone. Strength and power come if you know and control what others dare not show. Never reveal all that you know, or your enemies will take your seed, too. Hierarchy The Voice of Vecna Short of the Whispered One himself, the Voice is the highest position in the hierarchy of the cult. As the title implies, this position may only be held by one who speaks with Vecna's voice: his manifestation. The position is left vacant until such a time as the manifestation of Vecna chooses to reveal itself to the cult. After the prologue , the rank is wrongly given to Halmadar, until things are set straight. Vecna's Manifestation While the majority of Vecna's power is trapped beyond the planes, he can gather enough of it to channel into creating a manifestation akin to a lesser avatar. Echoing his title as the Maimed God, Vecna's manifestation takes the form of a humanoid maimed in some way, usually having lost one or more limbs to violence. The manifestation can be any humanoid creature, of any age, sex, gender, or race. The appearance it takes on is usually one that will further Vecna's needs. A manifestation of Vecna has the stats of a lich , with the following changes: Its creature type is humanoid. It loses the lich's Rejuvenation and Turn Resistance abilities. Its Disrupt Life ability affects each non-undead creature within range excluding itself. It does not have a lair and cannot take lair actions. It has a Strength of 14 (+2), a Wisdom of 19 (+4), History +19, Insight +18, Perception +11, and +11 to Wisdom saving throws. It has a Passive Perception of 21. It knows all languages. It can cast the legend lore spell at will, without requiring components and without expending a spell slot. Spidered Insight. As a bonus action, the manifestation targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the manifestation's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the manifestation wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target. The target is not aware that this ability has been used on it. If the manifestation is destroyed, it takes 1d100 days for Vecna to gather the power to form a new one. The new manifestation may take the same or a different form as he wishes. The manifestation may have other features and abilities depending on the form it has. If the manifestation regains the Eye and Hand of Vecna, it becomes even more powerful. The Heart of Vecna With the position of the Voice often vacant or detached from the day-to-day happenings of the cult, much of the actual leadership comes down to the Heart of Vecna. The Heart is the highest member of the priesthood, and it is through the Heart that the commands of the Whispered One are put into motion by directing the cult. Traditionally, the Heart of Vecna wears unadorned blood-red robes. The current Heart of Vecna is Her Most Enigmatic Excellency, Sublime Mistress of the Whispered One, Diraq Malcinex of Ket. The Eye and the Hand Through secret rituals and flesh-warping magics, the cult turns two of their faithful into beings known as the Eye and the Hand. These powerful creatures act as the Heart's lieutenants and enforcers and as such they only answer directly to her. When required, the Eye and the Hand are sent to assist individual cells of the cult in times of need, and will unquestionably follow the cell's Thought in order to complete their mission. But every cultist knows where the creatures' loyalties lie, and fear of the Heart's wrath keeps them from being used in any attempt to further a Thought's personal ends. The Thoughts of Vecna Each cell of the cult is lead by a high priest known as a Thought. The Thoughts lead the cultists both as an apparatus to carry out the plots of the Whispered One and as a congregation in worship of him. Lesser priests of a cell are subservient to the Thought, but may turn to using threats of blackmail against their superior in bids to take their position. The sheer power of the Thought usually keeps such attempts at bay. Traditionally, Thoughts of Vecna wear black robes patterned with forking lightning, signifying the speed and power of thought. The Adytum, the primary temple of Vecna and the cult's main headquarters, is led by the First Thought of Vecna . While all other Thoughts are of equal rank, the First Thought stands above them. The current First Thought of Vecna is Ugwaerel Malcinex .

The Mound The interior stonework is still largely intact, but becomes more cracked and worn deeper into the mound. Passages are clear of roots. In the fourth paragraph, the result of a collapse should instead read: \"The stone in a five foot area gives way, cascading rock and dirt into the tomb. Each creature under the collapsing roof must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fortunately, the tree roots keep such collapses from becoming worse. A collapse will not block a passage, but the area becomes difficult terrain.\" In the fifth paragraph, possibly describe that the wards on the tomb feel empowering, but the mechanical effects are negligible. The bonus to player saving throws and penalty to enemy attacks are ignored. Describing the feeling of the empowering wards is worthwhile in order to make note of the sense of losing them in the final chamber. Limitations on spells to escape are unchanged. The Occupant of the Mound Additionally, the seals and enchantments on Halmadar's prison were so potent that the pervasive evil of the Hand and Eye of Vecna weren't able to dissipate, instead building up and concentrating within the inner chamber of the mound. As Halmadar raged and starved in his prison, the evil of the artifacts manifested his emotions as sorrowsworn. Investigating the Mound As soon as the Circle of Eight arrive at the mound, Halmadar is warned of them by a premonition from the powers of the Eye and the Hand. He then expends 2 charges from the Eye to cast clairvoyance and places the sensor near the party. Everything else is the same except for anything to do with ESP. Remove the final paragraph entirely. 1. Entrance Unchanged. 2. The Outer Seal Treat mold as Yellow Mold from DMG. 3. The Vaulted Chamber This octagonal chamber arches up perhaps ten feet. The opposite wall has an archway leading into an unlit passage. In each of the other six walls is an alcove where a large humanoid statue stands. On a slightly raised dais in the center of the room is an unadorned stone sarcophagus. The impressive stonework is obviously aged and starting to crack, seeming worse for wear closer to the far entrance. The corruption of Halmadar and the artifacts are responsible for the accelerated decay deeper into the cairn. The statues nearer to the far archway are mostly broken. The sarcophagus in the center is unadorned and empty aside from some stone dust. It was intended for Halmadar's consort, but was never used due to the circumstances of his internment. Once all eight wizards are in the room and have spent some time looking around, but before any of them try to leave out the other door, 4-6 of the statues animate as stone golems and attack the members of the Circle. 4. Magical Trap Removed. 5. Pit Attempting to climb around the pit requires a DC 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, part of the pit edge, wall, and ceiling collapse and send the character into the pit. The fall and rubble deal 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage. Hiding in the murky water at the bottom of the pit are three Wretched . 6. The Inner Seal A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check will identify the inscriptions as being abjurative in nature, made easier (DC 10) if the outer seal was also examined, casting detect magic also reveals this. A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows the deduction that the ward is intended to keep something in, not out. In one side of the inscribed slab, there is a small crack. Spotting this requires a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Through this, the decay that has worn the rest of the cairn has leaked. This seal cannot be opened, broken, or otherwise manipulated until the wards are removed, which requires casting dispel magic with a DC 19, as if a 9th level spell. 7. Halmadar's Prison Replace the last two sentences of the boxed text with: A large stone platform fills one end of the chamber; atop it is an elaborately carved throne. The wood has begun to rot away, and a husk-like corpse is sits upon it with broken, rusted chains scattered around it, and a massive greatsword leaning against its side. On the floor before the platform is a large, intricate ouroboros, painted in what could only be blood. With the exception of the first paragraph, replace the entire rest of the section with the following: The body on the throne is none other than Halmadar the Cruel , if his clairvoyance spell is still active he is motionless while still focusing on it for a moment longer, but not long enough to make a difference in the following events. Hiding among the piles along the walls are the sorrowsworn manifestations of the warlord's rage at his internment and the starvation that lead to his death: 3 Hungry and 4 Angry . These sorrowsworn count as Halmadar's allies. The wizards have little time to orient themselves in the chamber. Not being one for subtlety, Halmadar engages the members of the Circle almost as soon as they enter his prison chamber. Prepared by the premonitions of the Eye and the Hand, and possibly the sensor of his clairvoyance , he is ready for them. Halmadar has advantage on his initiative roll, and all other creatures in the room are surprised for the first round of the encounter. Halmadar is boastful, claiming victory as soon as combat begins. He taunts the Circle for falling into his trap and freeing him. He thinks that he is Vecna, introducing himself with many of the archlich's titles as he rises from the throne and hefts his sword, but when he speaks the name \"Vecna\" it is instead heard only as a faint, incomprehensible whisper. After the first round where the wizards and the sorrowsworn are surprised, combat proceeds as normal. It is required that the Circle of Eight fall here. This fight should be impossible, and it should feel impossible, but it shouldn't feel cheap. As much as possible the players should feel like they were fairly beaten by an unbelievably powerful foe, and not like they were cheated (such as by instant kills while time is frozen). If required, have more sorrowsworn emerge from the detritus, thematically they should be Angry since Halmadar spent much longer being angry than hungry, but some Hungry can be included for variety.

Depending on which member of the Circle they were connected to, members of the party may know of some or all of these. Otherwise, they might find directions through other means. Jallarzi Sallavarian Jallarzi's mansion is in the city's High Quarter, at H16. It is described on GoF61. Jallarzi sent her servants on vacation before she left with the rest of the Circle of Eight. Her vast but unfurnished house is uninhabited except for Edwina, her pseudodragon familiar she left behind because of her not getting along with Otiluke. Edwina Edwina is Jallarzi's familiar, a wild pseudodragon that the wizard befriended some time ago. This means she cannot be dismissed or summoned using the find familiar spell. Edwina has the stats of a pseudodragon (familiar variant) . When found, she will be immediately friendly with any member of the party who is not Otiluke's contact, but she will become especially attached to one of them, in the following order of preference: The character who is Jallarzi's contact Any elf or halfling that is not Otiluke's contact Any other character that is not Otiluke's contact The character who is Otiluke's contact Kindness from Otiluke's contact will eventually earn Edwina's favour, and she will not stay friendly with any member of the party who is unkind to her. If the character she initially attached to is cruel or unkind to her, she will abandon the party. With some effort, the character that Edwina became attached to can earn her trust and gain her as a familiar. Until this happens, that character does not get the benefits of her familiar trait. The mansion is largely unfurnished aside from the parlour, master suite, and a few guest suites. The master suite and two of the guest suites show evidence of having been lately occupied and not cleaned since. What Edwina knows Jallarzi was very concerned with whatever she and the other wizards were investigating, but glad for the chance to prove herself Tenser and Rary both stayed with Jallarzi in the house She accompanied Jallarzi on trips to Grey College and the Guild library, as well as meetings with the other Circle members in the house, at the Guild, and elsewhere Otto Otto's cottage is in the city's Garden Quarter, at G2. It is described on GoF63. What the groundkeepers know Otto was staying for several weeks and seemed much more frantic than usual He left a couple weeks ago and hasn't been seen since, which isn't unusual for him He was meeting up with various other wizard-types, but particularly closely with a short, small-looking one (Otiluke) came by often Otiluke Otiluke's house is in the city's River Quarter, at R15. It is described on GoF83. The house is inhabited by a handful of servants and a young woman named Glorial. Glorial (CG human apprentice wizard , she/her) is roughly half Otiluke's age (early 20s), and has been living with the older mage for nearly one and a half years now as his apprentice and, more recently, concubine. (Otiluke is a creep.) What Glorial knows Otiluke was frantically investigating something with a group of other wizards she didn't recognize. He was spending a lot of time with a curly-haired fat one (Otto) at Grey College. They also visited several temples in the city. She's not sure which but assumes the House of Boccob to be a good place to start. Street The River Quarter The Rhennee The priests of Trithereon or Olidammara know Yagos Slevak specifically The clannishness of the Rhennee makes questioning them difficult Asking about Almarth the Halt or Yagos Slevak will get back to them, and they will be smuggled out of the city Best way to get info is through an introduction, like through one of the temples. Xerbo is a good one for this Questions about the cult to non-cultists are met by fear and apprehension No matter how they approach questioning the Rhennee, they are eventually approached by Turim Varostak What the Rhennee Know Call the Cult of Vecna \"The Cult of the Seeing Hand\" Know the cult to be an evil group that has been gaining traction among their clan (though won't name names, and don't know any in specific) Know of the Eye and the Hand , and tell their children of them to scare them, but believe them to be real ~~Recommend going to Dyvers or Verbobonc for more information, cult is more active there~~ Remember wizards nosing around the waterfront some weeks ago Turim Varostak Turim Varostak is Vecna's manifestation on Oerth. He appears to be a tall, wiry, grizzled human sailor with thinning white hair and a permanent scowl. He is an honorary Rhennee, a fact indicated by a charm he wears dangling from his belt. His entire left side is badly scarred and mutilated. He has a peg in place of his left leg, a leather cuff ending with a hook over his left forearm, and a patch over his left eye. Claims to be a bargemaster Has various different stories as to his injuries. \"A sahuagin attack down by Saltmarsh\" etc. Acts as if wanting to help, actually wants the party's help in tracking down Halmadar and regaining his place as the Voice Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar After answering basics, he will disappear for a night and extract all information that Yagos knows, Yagos is found dead the next morning Will only give Yagos' intel if party lets him come along on the journey (to avenge the honour of the clan that took him in) and offers his boat and crew Ingratiated himself with the clan by risking his life in attempt to rescue Avrel's brother, although he failed (or so he says, actually a memory implanted by the powers of Vecna). Hence his injuries Yagos Slevak Yagos Slevak is the leader of the Fingers of Vecna among the Rhennee and in the region. He is a weaselly, oily sycophant of a man who may seem helpless but is actually quite dangerous. Rightfully mistrusted by most other Rhennee, but clannishness will still protect him unless outed as cultist Will not reveal status as cultist of Vecna Acts cooperative, hoping to lead the party into a trap far from the city Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar Claims to have stumbled across a group of cultists in Verbobonc a few months ago and is being blackmailed by them Pretends to be afraid of the cult and requires significant payment in advance for his services Knows the location of the temple in Verbobonc and the rumors of Vecna's return Knows of the importance of Osnabr\u00f6lt but doesn't know what's there Hopes to stay alive by being useful, will keep information to himself but offers to take party there in person If his status as a cultist is made public, the Rhennee will turn on him. If they want his continued assistance, the party must negotiate for his life. This will only be allowed if the Rhennee can keep him under guard, requiring the party to travel with them. Almarth the Halt The players might recognize him from the attack at the Roc and Oliphant. If exposed, meets the same end as Yagos Knows as much as Yagos Cannot be forced to talk Won't go down without a fight Smuggled the Eye and the Hand into the city, as well as other cultists Will accidentally out Yagos as a co-conspirator if convinced that he was betrayed Might not out Yagos as a cultist specifically, may only indicate he was the captain of the ship he served on when smuggling cult members into Greyhawk Avrel Riskar Avrel Riskar is a Rhennee noble and a senior member of one of the clans currently in Greyhawk. Could be found just asking around or through introduction by priests of Xerbo Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar !!! note \"Family\": - Husband: Marcel Vali (NG Rhennee human druid , he/him) - Brother: Morlo Vergond (Deceased, he/him) - Niece: Rona Fele (CN Rhennee human swashbuckler , she/they) [relevant in our campaign specifically, might cut from final] The Thieves' Guild Very territorial.

They will not participate in the meeting personally, but are invested in the outcomes of the noble's deliberations The meeting is carried out entirely in Rhopan If the party wants to travel with the Rhennee, they could seek passage with whichever of the clans does not stay in the city, provided they pay for the service or are able to assure their usefulness aboard the ships But before they can do that, a decision has to be made on who stays or leaves If the characters have met Avrel Riskar already, they may be able to talk to him during one of the recesses in deliberations If they are on good terms with Avrel and play their needs well, he can be convinced to send one of his boats to take them to Verbobonc while the deliberations continue, but this will be exceedingly difficult If the players want to wait out the discussions, they drag on, proceed through the events of An Interlude If things are totally stuck, have one of the three clans at random be the one to set out, and they can attempt to get passage with them If either Almarth or Yagos have been outed as cultists, the dynamic is different As members of Avrel's clan, Almarth and/or Yagos' identity as cultists casts a shadow on the entire clan This has put pressure on Avrel to be the one to agree to leave the city for the winter, the two other nobles pressing him on it So far Avrel's seniority has allowed him to hold the other two off, but it won't last forever (it will however last long enough to prevent the party from travelling with the clan in a timely manner) If they know that the cult is in Verbobonc, the party can convince Avrel that a) agreeing to have his clan be the one to leave and b) helping the party to Verbobonc to deal with the cult, will help regain his clan's standing in the eyes of the others The difficulty with this approach is not in convincing Avrel of it, but in identifying it It will require strong insight into Rhennee culture and the current social dynamic between the three clans here, which might be aided by a character coming from a culture with similar clannishness If convinced, Avrel will immediately and emphatically announce his clan's departure. They will set out the next day at noon As soon as the deliberations are concluded, the clan barriers fall and intermingling resumes, festivities starting for the night to send off the departing clan Level Advancement The characters advance from 4th to 5th level upon setting out from Greyhawk on the Circle of Eight's trail.
