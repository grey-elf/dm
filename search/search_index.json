With his name struck from the memory of the Oerth, the Cult of Vecna is never referred to as such. Instead, it is normally called the Cult of the Whispered One by the few who even know it exists. Individual cells of the cult use names such as the following: Followers of the Whispered One Disciples of the Hand and the Eye Maimed God's Chosen Servants of the Spider Throne Until the adventure's beginning, the cult had been biding their time and spreading their reach, but had been mostly kept in check by the Spurned Cult of Iuz, their chief rivals. Still, their prophecies forewarned their lord's return in this year, and they had been making preparations. Further details on Vecna's plan can be found in the Story Overview No matter how powerful a being is, there exists a secret that can destroy him. In every heart is a seed of darkness hidden from all others; find that evil seed, and your enemies are undone. Strength and power come if you know and control what others dare not show. Never reveal all that you know, or your enemies will take your seed, too. Hierarchy The Voice of Vecna Short of the Whispered One himself, the Voice is the highest position in the hierarchy of the cult. As the title implies, this position may only be held by one who speaks with Vecna's voice: his manifestation. The position is left vacant until such a time as the manifestation of Vecna chooses to reveal itself to the cult. After the prologue , the rank is wrongly given to Halmadar, until things are set straight. Vecna's Manifestation While the majority of Vecna's power is trapped beyond the planes, he can gather enough of it to channel into creating a manifestation akin to a lesser avatar. Echoing his title as the Maimed God, Vecna's manifestation takes the form of a humanoid maimed in some way, usually having lost one or more limbs to violence. The manifestation can be any humanoid creature, of any age, sex, gender, or race. The appearance it takes on is usually one that will further Vecna's needs. A manifestation of Vecna has the stats of a lich , with the following changes: Its creature type is humanoid. It loses the lich's Rejuvenation and Turn Resistance abilities. Its Disrupt Life ability affects each non-undead creature within range excluding itself. It does not have a lair and cannot take lair actions. It has a Strength of 14 (+2), a Wisdom of 19 (+4), History +19, Insight +18, Perception +11, and +11 to Wisdom saving throws. It has a Passive Perception of 21. It knows all languages. It can cast the legend lore spell at will, without requiring components and without expending a spell slot. Spidered Insight. As a bonus action, the manifestation targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the manifestation's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the manifestation wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target or that the target knows. The target is not aware that this ability has been used on it. If the manifestation is destroyed, it takes 1d100 days for Vecna to gather the power to form a new one. The new manifestation may take the same or a different form as he wishes. The manifestation may have other features and abilities depending on the form it has. If the manifestation regains the Eye and Hand of Vecna, it becomes even more powerful. The Heart of Vecna With the position of the Voice often vacant or detached from the day-to-day happenings of the cult, much of the actual leadership comes down to the Heart of Vecna. The Heart is the highest member of the priesthood, and it is through the Heart that the commands of the Whispered One are put into motion by directing the cult. Traditionally, the Heart of Vecna wears unadorned blood-red robes. The current Heart of Vecna is Her Most Enigmatic Excellency, Sublime Mistress of the Whispered One, Diraq Malcinex of Ket. The Eye and the Hand Through secret rituals and flesh-warping magics, the cult turns two of their faithful into beings known as the Eye and the Hand. These powerful creatures act as the Heart's lieutenants and enforcers and as such they only answer directly to her. When required, the Eye and the Hand are sent to assist individual cells of the cult in times of need, and will unquestionably follow the cell's Thought in order to complete their mission. But every cultist knows where the creatures' loyalties lie, and fear of the Heart's wrath keeps them from being used in any attempt to further a Thought's personal ends. The Thoughts of Vecna Each cell of the cult is lead by a high priest known as a Thought. The Thoughts lead the cultists both as an apparatus to carry out the plots of the Whispered One and as a congregation in worship of him. Lesser priests of a cell are subservient to the Thought, but may turn to using threats of blackmail against their superior in bids to take their position. The sheer power of the Thought usually keeps such attempts at bay. Traditionally, Thoughts of Vecna wear black robes patterned with forking lightning, signifying the speed and power of thought. The Adytum, the primary temple of Vecna and the cult's main headquarters, is led by the First Thought of Vecna . While all other Thoughts are of equal rank, the First Thought stands above them. The current First Thought of Vecna is Ugwaerel Malcinex . Cult Ranks and Stat Blocks ex: In many cases, Memories and Thoughts might be less powerful than Teeth, but their greater devotion gives them a higher rank within the religious hierarchy. As Vecna's power is regained, his followers also become more powerful. Over time, even those in lower ranks of the cult are represented by creatures with greater CRs, and they are granted additional special abilities. These new abilities are gained when the Manifestation of Vecna recovers the Eye and Hand of Vecna (at the end of Vecna Lives), and then again when the ritual is carried out to draw in the powers of Vecna from the Outer Planes so he can be reborn (at the end of Vecna Reborn), but when he is drawn into the Demiplane of Dread his remaining followers on the Prime Material Plane lose some other abilities as well. This will be addressed in each book. The Memories of Vecna Acolyte Cult Fanatic Priest Vecnan priests (Thoughts and Memories) have access to Arcana, Death, and Knowledge Domain spells The Teeth of Vecna Apprentice Wizard Illusionist Enchanter Conjurer Mage Diviner Necromancer Archmage The Fingers of Vecna Dye fingers red. Spy Swashbuckler? Master Thief Assassin The Blood of Vecna Smear red dye across face. Thug Veteran Champion The Disciples of Vecna Faces painted white. Sometimes only upper half of face. Sometimes with eye on forehead. Cultist Cult Fanatic The Spawn of Vecna Disciples who fail the initiation into the higher mysteries that are required of the Memories are transformed into what is referred to by the cult as the \"Spawn of Vecna.\" Sometimes this might also occur as punishment, or simply when a cultist discovers a secret they cannot comprehend (which is considered to be punishment from Vecna himself.)

It has a Strength of 14 (+2), a Wisdom of 19 (+4), History +19, Insight +18, Perception +11, and +11 to Wisdom saving throws. It has a Passive Perception of 21. It knows all languages. It can cast the legend lore spell at will, without requiring components and without expending a spell slot. Spidered Insight. As a bonus action, the manifestation targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the manifestation's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the manifestation wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target or that the target knows. The target is not aware that this ability has been used on it. If the manifestation is destroyed, it takes 1d100 days for Vecna to gather the power to form a new one. The new manifestation may take the same or a different form as he wishes. The manifestation may have other features and abilities depending on the form it has. If the manifestation regains the Eye and Hand of Vecna, it becomes even more powerful.","title":"The Voice of Vecna"},{"location":"overview/the-cult-of-vecna/#the-heart-of-vecna","text":"With the position of the Voice often vacant or detached from the day-to-day happenings of the cult, much of the actual leadership comes down to the Heart of Vecna. The Heart is the highest member of the priesthood, and it is through the Heart that the commands of the Whispered One are put into motion by directing the cult. Traditionally, the Heart of Vecna wears unadorned blood-red robes.

These powerful creatures act as the Heart's lieutenants and enforcers and as such they only answer directly to her. When required, the Eye and the Hand are sent to assist individual cells of the cult in times of need, and will unquestionably follow the cell's Thought in order to complete their mission. But every cultist knows where the creatures' loyalties lie, and fear of the Heart's wrath keeps them from being used in any attempt to further a Thought's personal ends.","title":"The Eye and the Hand"},{"location":"overview/the-cult-of-vecna/#the-thoughts-of-vecna","text":"Each cell of the cult is lead by a high priest known as a Thought. The Thoughts lead the cultists both as an apparatus to carry out the plots of the Whispered One and as a congregation in worship of him. Lesser priests of a cell are subservient to the Thought, but may turn to using threats of blackmail against their superior in bids to take their position. The sheer power of the Thought usually keeps such attempts at bay. Traditionally, Thoughts of Vecna wear black robes patterned with forking lightning, signifying the speed and power of thought. The Adytum, the primary temple of Vecna and the cult's main headquarters, is led by the First Thought of Vecna . While all other Thoughts are of equal rank, the First Thought stands above them. The current First Thought of Vecna is Ugwaerel Malcinex . Cult Ranks and Stat Blocks ex: In many cases, Memories and Thoughts might be less powerful than Teeth, but their greater devotion gives them a higher rank within the religious hierarchy. As Vecna's power is regained, his followers also become more powerful. Over time, even those in lower ranks of the cult are represented by creatures with greater CRs, and they are granted additional special abilities. These new abilities are gained when the Manifestation of Vecna recovers the Eye and Hand of Vecna (at the end of Vecna Lives), and then again when the ritual is carried out to draw in the powers of Vecna from the Outer Planes so he can be reborn (at the end of Vecna Reborn), but when he is drawn into the Demiplane of Dread his remaining followers on the Prime Material Plane lose some other abilities as well.

Source: LGJ0p6 The Circle of Eight No need to treat your players like children, just tell them that for a prologue they will be playing different characters. If your players are children, this probably isn't the right adventure for them. Let players each chose a member of the Circle of Eight, any additional will be effectively run as sidekicks. Tell the players to think about how their character might know this wizard, but they don't need to decide yet. The Mound The interior stonework is still largely intact, but becomes more cracked and worn deeper into the mound. Passages are clear of roots. In the fourth paragraph, the result of a collapse should instead read: \"The stone in a five foot area gives way, cascading rock and dirt into the tomb. Each creature under the collapsing roof must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fortunately, the tree roots keep such collapses from becoming worse. A collapse will not block a passage, but the area becomes difficult terrain.\" In the fifth paragraph, possibly describe that the wards on the tomb feel empowering, but the mechanical effects are negligible. The bonus to player saving throws and penalty to enemy attacks are ignored. Describing the feeling of the empowering wards is worthwhile in order to make note of the sense of losing them in the final chamber. Limitations on spells to escape are unchanged. The Occupant of the Mound Additionally, the seals and enchantments on Halmadar's prison were so potent that the pervasive evil of the Hand and Eye of Vecna weren't able to dissipate, instead building up and concentrating within the inner chamber of the mound. As Halmadar raged and starved in his prison, the evil of the artifacts manifested his emotions as sorrowsworn. Investigating the Mound As soon as the Circle of Eight arrive at the mound, Halmadar is warned of them by a premonition from the powers of the Eye and the Hand. He then expends 2 charges from the Eye to cast clairvoyance and places the sensor near the party. Everything else is the same except for anything to do with ESP. Remove the final paragraph entirely. 1. Entrance Unchanged. 2. The Outer Seal Treat mold as Yellow Mold from DMG. 3. The Vaulted Chamber This octagonal chamber arches up perhaps ten feet. The opposite wall has an archway leading into an unlit passage. In each of the other six walls is an alcove where a large humanoid statue stands. On a slightly raised dais in the center of the room is an unadorned stone sarcophagus. The impressive stonework is obviously aged and starting to crack, seeming worse for wear closer to the far entrance. The corruption of Halmadar and the artifacts are responsible for the accelerated decay deeper into the cairn. The statues nearer to the far archway are mostly broken. The sarcophagus in the center is unadorned and empty aside from some stone dust. It was intended for Halmadar's consort, but was never used due to the circumstances of his internment. Once all eight wizards are in the room and have spent some time looking around, but before any of them try to leave out the other door, 4-6 of the statues animate as stone golems and attack the members of the Circle. 4. Magical Trap Removed. 5. Pit Attempting to climb around the pit requires a DC 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, part of the pit edge, wall, and ceiling collapse and send the character into the pit. The fall and rubble deal 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage. Hiding in the murky water at the bottom of the pit are three Wretched . 6. The Inner Seal A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check will identify the inscriptions as being abjurative in nature, made easier (DC 10) if the outer seal was also examined, casting detect magic also reveals this. A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows the deduction that the ward is intended to keep something in, not out. In one side of the inscribed slab, there is a small crack. Spotting this requires a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Through this, the decay that has worn the rest of the cairn has leaked. This seal cannot be opened, broken, or otherwise manipulated until the wards are removed, which requires casting dispel magic with a DC 19, as if a 9th level spell. 7. Halmadar's Prison Replace the last two sentences of the boxed text with: A large stone platform fills one end of the chamber; atop it is an elaborately carved throne. The wood has begun to rot away, and a husk-like corpse is sits upon it with broken, rusted chains scattered around it, and a massive greatsword leaning against its side.

Hiding among the piles along the walls are the sorrowsworn manifestations of the warlord's rage at his internment and the starvation that lead to his death: 3 Hungry and 4 Angry . These sorrowsworn count as Halmadar's allies. The wizards have little time to orient themselves in the chamber. Not being one for subtlety, Halmadar engages the members of the Circle almost as soon as they enter his prison chamber. Prepared by the premonitions of the Eye and the Hand, and possibly the sensor of his clairvoyance , he is ready for them. Halmadar has advantage on his initiative roll, and all other creatures in the room are surprised for the first round of the encounter. Halmadar is boastful, claiming victory as soon as combat begins. He taunts the Circle for falling into his trap and freeing him. He thinks that he is Vecna, introducing himself with many of the archlich's titles as he rises from the throne and hefts his sword, but when he speaks the name \"Vecna\" it is instead heard only as a faint, incomprehensible whisper. After the first round where the wizards and the sorrowsworn are surprised, combat proceeds as normal. It is required that the Circle of Eight fall here. This fight should be impossible, and it should feel impossible, but it shouldn't feel cheap. As much as possible the players should feel like they were fairly beaten by an unbelievably powerful foe, and not like they were cheated (such as by instant kills while time is frozen). If required, have more sorrowsworn emerge from the detritus, thematically they should be Angry since Halmadar spent much longer being angry than hungry, but some Hungry can be included for variety.

Also at the College is Arklan Sammal (LN human master sage , he/him) who is a historian of some repute and a professor of Baklunish history at the school. He is also Rary's younger brother. The Great Library of Greyhawk Map Should a map of the Great Library be required, Dyson Logos' The Grand Library of Coruvon would make a good choice. As a mundane civilian library it has a more normal architecture, which helps contrast it with the stranger Library of the Wizard's Guild. The Books In order to gain information from any of the books a character must be able to read the language the book is written in, either by knowing the language or a related dialect, or using an ability such as the warlock's Eyes of the Runekeeper . If the character knows only a related dialect, any scanning checks are made at disadvantage and fully reading the book takes the maximum possible time. If a character relies on comprehend languages to read or scan a book, the time to do so is doubled. If the characters are unable to read or understand the importance of any of the books, they should think to seek out experts in the city for aid.

Depending on which member of the Circle they were connected to, members of the party may know of some or all of these. Otherwise, they might find directions through other means. Jallarzi Sallavarian Jallarzi's mansion is in the city's High Quarter, at H16. It is described on GoF61. Jallarzi sent her servants on vacation before she left with the rest of the Circle of Eight. Her vast but unfurnished house is uninhabited except for Edwina, her pseudodragon familiar she left behind because of her not getting along with Otiluke. Edwina Edwina is Jallarzi's familiar, a wild pseudodragon that the wizard befriended some time ago. This means she cannot be dismissed or summoned using the find familiar spell. Edwina has the stats of a pseudodragon (familiar variant) . When found, she will be immediately friendly with any member of the party who is not Otiluke's contact, but she will become especially attached to one of them, in the following order of preference: The character who is Jallarzi's contact Any elf or halfling that is not Otiluke's contact Any other character that is not Otiluke's contact The character who is Otiluke's contact Kindness from Otiluke's contact will eventually earn Edwina's favour, and she will not stay friendly with any member of the party who is unkind to her. If the character she initially attached to is cruel or unkind to her, she will abandon the party. With some effort, the character that Edwina became attached to can earn her trust and gain her as a familiar. Until this happens, that character does not get the benefits of her familiar trait. The mansion is largely unfurnished aside from the parlour, master suite, and a few guest suites. The master suite and two of the guest suites show evidence of having been lately occupied and not cleaned since. What Edwina knows Jallarzi was very concerned with whatever she and the other wizards were investigating, but glad for the chance to prove herself Tenser and Rary both stayed with Jallarzi in the house She accompanied Jallarzi on trips to Grey College and the Guild library, as well as meetings with the other Circle members in the house, at the Guild, and elsewhere Otto Otto's cottage is in the city's Garden Quarter, at G2. It is described on GoF63. What the groundkeepers know Otto was staying for several weeks and seemed much more frantic than usual He left a couple weeks ago and hasn't been seen since, which isn't unusual for him He was meeting up with various other wizard-types, but particularly closely with a short, small-looking one (Otiluke) came by often Otiluke Otiluke's house is in the city's River Quarter, at R15. It is described on GoF83. The house is inhabited by a handful of servants and a young woman named Glorial. Glorial (CG human apprentice wizard , she/her) is roughly half Otiluke's age (early 20s), and has been living with the older mage for nearly one and a half years now as his apprentice and, more recently, concubine. (Otiluke is a creep.) What Glorial knows Otiluke was frantically investigating something with a group of other wizards she didn't recognize. He was spending a lot of time with a curly-haired fat one (Otto) at Grey College. They also visited several temples in the city. She's not sure which but assumes the House of Boccob to be a good place to start. Street The River Quarter The Rhennee The priests of Trithereon or Olidammara know Yagos Slevak specifically The clannishness of the Rhennee makes questioning them difficult Asking about Almarth the Halt or Yagos Slevak will get back to them, and they will be smuggled out of the city Best way to get info is through an introduction, like through one of the temples. Xerbo is a good one for this Questions about the cult to non-cultists are met by fear and apprehension No matter how they approach questioning the Rhennee, they are eventually approached by Turim Varostak What the Rhennee Know Call the Cult of Vecna \"The Cult of the Seeing Hand\" Know the cult to be an evil group that has been gaining traction among their clan (though won't name names, and don't know any in specific) Know of the Eye and the Hand , and tell their children of them to scare them, but believe them to be real ~~Recommend going to Dyvers or Verbobonc for more information, cult is more active there~~ Remember wizards nosing around the waterfront some weeks ago Turim Varostak Turim Varostak is Vecna's manifestation on Oerth. He appears to be a tall, wiry, grizzled human sailor with thinning white hair and a permanent scowl. He is an honorary Rhennee, a fact indicated by a charm he wears dangling from his belt. His entire left side is badly scarred and mutilated. He has a peg in place of his left leg, a leather cuff ending with a hook over his left forearm, and a patch over his left eye. Claims to be a bargemaster Has various different stories as to his injuries. \"A sahuagin attack down by Saltmarsh\" etc. Acts as if wanting to help, actually wants the party's help in tracking down Halmadar and regaining his place as the Voice Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar After answering basics, he will disappear for a night and extract all information that Yagos knows, Yagos is found dead the next morning Will only give Yagos' intel if party lets him come along on the journey (to avenge the honour of the clan that took him in) and offers his boat and crew Ingratiated himself with the clan by risking his life in attempt to rescue Avrel's brother, although he failed (or so he says, actually a memory implanted by the powers of Vecna). Hence his injuries Yagos Slevak Yagos Slevak is the leader of the Fingers of Vecna among the Rhennee and in the region. He is a weaselly, oily sycophant of a man who may seem helpless but is actually quite dangerous. Rightfully mistrusted by most other Rhennee, but clannishness will still protect him unless outed as cultist Will not reveal status as cultist of Vecna Acts cooperative, hoping to lead the party into a trap far from the city Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar Claims to have stumbled across a group of cultists in Verbobonc a few months ago and is being blackmailed by them Pretends to be afraid of the cult and requires significant payment in advance for his services Knows the location of the temple in Verbobonc and the rumors of Vecna's return Knows of the importance of Osnabr\u00f6lt but doesn't know what's there Hopes to stay alive by being useful, will keep information to himself but offers to take party there in person If his status as a cultist is made public, the Rhennee will turn on him. If they want his continued assistance, the party must negotiate for his life. This will only be allowed if the Rhennee can keep him under guard, requiring the party to travel with them. Almarth the Halt The players might recognize him from the attack at the Roc and Oliphant. If exposed, meets the same end as Yagos Knows as much as Yagos Cannot be forced to talk Won't go down without a fight Smuggled the Eye and the Hand into the city, as well as other cultists Will accidentally out Yagos as a co-conspirator if convinced that he was betrayed Might not out Yagos as a cultist specifically, may only indicate he was the captain of the ship he served on when smuggling cult members into Greyhawk Avrel Riskar Avrel Riskar is a Rhennee noble and a senior member of one of the clans currently in Greyhawk. Could be found just asking around or through introduction by priests of Xerbo Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar !!! note \"Family\": - Husband: Marcel Vali (NG Rhennee human druid , he/him) - Brother: Morlo Vergond (Deceased, he/him) - Niece: Rona Fele (CN Rhennee human swashbuckler , she/they) [relevant in our campaign specifically, might cut from final] The Thieves' Guild Very territorial.

They will not participate in the meeting personally, but are invested in the outcomes of the noble's deliberations The meeting is carried out entirely in Rhopan If the party wants to travel with the Rhennee, they could seek passage with whichever of the clans does not stay in the city, provided they pay for the service or are able to assure their usefulness aboard the ships But before they can do that, a decision has to be made on who stays or leaves If the characters have met Avrel Riskar already, they may be able to talk to him during one of the recesses in deliberations If they are on good terms with Avrel and play their needs well, he can be convinced to send one of his boats to take them to Verbobonc while the deliberations continue, but this will be exceedingly difficult If the players want to wait out the discussions, they drag on, proceed through the events of An Interlude If things are totally stuck, have one of the three clans at random be the one to set out, and they can attempt to get passage with them If either Almarth or Yagos have been outed as cultists, the dynamic is different As members of Avrel's clan, Almarth and/or Yagos' identity as cultists casts a shadow on the entire clan This has put pressure on Avrel to be the one to agree to leave the city for the winter, the two other nobles pressing him on it So far Avrel's seniority has allowed him to hold the other two off, but it won't last forever (it will however last long enough to prevent the party from travelling with the clan in a timely manner) If they know that the cult is in Verbobonc, the party can convince Avrel that a) agreeing to have his clan be the one to leave and b) helping the party to Verbobonc to deal with the cult, will help regain his clan's standing in the eyes of the others The difficulty with this approach is not in convincing Avrel of it, but in identifying it It will require strong insight into Rhennee culture and the current social dynamic between the three clans here, which might be aided by a character coming from a culture with similar clannishness If convinced, Avrel will immediately and emphatically announce his clan's departure. They will set out the next day at noon As soon as the deliberations are concluded, the clan barriers fall and intermingling resumes, festivities starting for the night to send off the departing clan Avrel will only tell the bargemasters of the true reason of them going to Verbobonc, in order to track the cult. This means that Yagos, himself a cultist, knows unless he was outed as a cultist as well.

When found, she will be immediately friendly with any member of the party who is not Otiluke's contact, but she will become especially attached to one of them, in the following order of preference: The character who is Jallarzi's contact Any elf or halfling that is not Otiluke's contact Any other character that is not Otiluke's contact The character who is Otiluke's contact Kindness from Otiluke's contact will eventually earn Edwina's favour, and she will not stay friendly with any member of the party who is unkind to her. If the character she initially attached to is cruel or unkind to her, she will abandon the party. With some effort, the character that Edwina became attached to can earn her trust and gain her as a familiar. Until this happens, that character does not get the benefits of her familiar trait. The mansion is largely unfurnished aside from the parlour, master suite, and a few guest suites. The master suite and two of the guest suites show evidence of having been lately occupied and not cleaned since. What Edwina knows Jallarzi was very concerned with whatever she and the other wizards were investigating, but glad for the chance to prove herself Tenser and Rary both stayed with Jallarzi in the house She accompanied Jallarzi on trips to Grey College and the Guild library, as well as meetings with the other Circle members in the house, at the Guild, and elsewhere","title":"Jallarzi Sallavarian"},{"location":"vl/3-research/#otto","text":"Otto's cottage is in the city's Garden Quarter, at G2.

If they have ensured the Avrel they will track the cult to help regain his clan's reputation, or followed the information from Almarth that this is where he brought the cultists to Greyhawk from, this should be clear to them. But if they are fixated on the vague news they have from Osnabr\u00f6lt or on the fate of the Circle of Eight, are confused, or are too focused on some other direction, they can be nudged in the right direction if required. If Turim is with the party and has either been told or somehow else found out that the party is seeking the Cult of Vecna, he immediately and very conspicuously begins asking around about the cult. It is in his best interest to do so, since even alerting the cult will help him find them and claim his rightful position as the Voice of Vecna . This very quickly ensures that not only the cult, but other power groups in the city are aware of the party and their search. If the party travelled with Yagos ~~and are aware of his status as a cultist~~, he tells them that he will arrange a meeting with a contact of his within the cult that can get them to the temple in the city. The contact in question is Oaklin . If allowed to meet privately, they make plans for Yagos to take the party to the Rock Powder Inn where they will rendezvous with Oaklin, who will then lead them to an ambush at the quarry at night, under the pretense of it being a cult ceremony and the party arriving as new inductees. If the two aren't allowed to converse in private, Yagos will meet Oaklin with any party members who wish to be present, and introduce them to Oaklin as potential new disciples. Yagos will attempt to secretly convey to Oaklin that they are actually enemies of the cult and need to be dealt with, his deception can be seen through by making a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by Yagos' Charisma (Deception) check. Characters who do not know thieves' cant make the check at disadvantage, and may be unable determine the actual meaning of the coded exchange. If the secret message is able to go by unnoticed and uninterrupted, Oaklin sets up the same plan as if the two of them were able to meet alone. revision note: Yagos will play this slightly differently if he is known to be a cultist, or if he is acting as if he only knows about the cult and is acting out of fear of them. If the party arrived with the Rhennee fleet and Yagos has not been outed, he secretly informed the Cult of the party and their investigation. This makes its way up the cult structure in Verbobonc, then the Thought of the Organ dispatched one of their top operatives to tail them: the leader of the Fingers in Verbobonc, Oaklin the Half-Elf News from Kieren Whenever the party determines that they are in a safe location to do so, they can contact Kieren with a sending as indicated they should do when they were in transit. When they do so, if the sending stone was used, they might be surprised that the response comes in Mordenkainen's voice: Have to trust your determination of security, we cannot scry you. Wait. We will be making contact shortly, this is a complex ritual. If Kieren is specifically targeted with a sending spell, she conveys something similar in her own manner. Alternate Approach (for my game, will probably cut from final) Option: Instead, Mordenkainen's response is I have arranged a meeting with the Bishop, he will be providing aid. Go to the Cathedral of St. Cuthbert, tell them Mordenkainen sent you. When they do so, the characters are brought in by the priests (who were given descriptions of the party) to the Bishop's private garden. On a table is an assortment of finger foods. A few moments later the Bishop and Alimora come in. Once basic introductions are complete, the Bishop puts on a ring similar to the one that Kieren wore in Chapter 2, signaling to Mordenkainen that they are gathered, and the scene proceeds as below. Projected images of Mordenkainen and Kieren appear to the characters, meanwhile the two of them and Ravel Dasinder are in the peak of the pyramid that contains the Greyhawk University of Magical Arts. Details: The divination blackout isn't just spreading, it's becoming more intense in places More and more divinations are starting to fail (lower and lower level spells) Contact to the gods is becoming difficult (higher level cleric and paladin powers are failing) insert other things here depending on how much time has passed and following progression from An Interlude earlier Just this sort of telepresence is exceedingly difficult, the ritual is requiring all three of them to channel it in order to work, from a magically amplifying location (the wizard school), and even then it's unknown how long it will last It is also spreading, blanketing more of the Flanaess List some countries affected Mordenkainen managed to track source of blackout to two sites One was deep within the borders of Iuz, and already thoroughly controlled by the Old One's forces How was Iuz ahead of them in finding it? By the source being within its borders, the Empire of Iuz must have noticed and subsequently tracked and found the source faster The other was in southern Keoland, where Mordenkainen found it (maybe in the Dreadwood?) Site was a ruined temple, serpent and eye-in-hand imagery were prevalent, indicates cult connection and longevity In the temple, found a stone tablet that seems to be the specific source of the blackout Moving the tablet from the temple moved the blackout epicenter with it The tablet appears to describe some sort of ritual, it's imbued with extremely powerful magic, and is as old as it and the temple seem It's difficult to tell for sure, all divination magic fails too close to it, so spells like identify are useless Relying on mundane observation and research instead [Our campaign specific] This was confirmed by a second opinion from a contact of Nystul's in the church of Bleredd, who was also reached by the vision of the Circle falling Mordenkainen brought her to Verbobonc to meet them, she is waiting at the temple of Saint Cuthbert The Bishop insists on knowing about the cult investigation, he has invited the party to lunch (whenever that makes sense to be) For now, he has taken the tablet to his citadel in the Yatil Mountains for study, which has lessened the blackout over Greyhawk The City City slogan: \"Earth and Stone, Man and Gnome\" His Noble Lordship, the Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc (LG Oeridian human noble or veteran , he/him) Despite substantial mineral riches and significant trade power bringing much affluence to the Viscounty, not all of the region's residents are advantaged by this wealth, especially in the town of Verbobonc itself. Many were once caravaneers who lost their livelihoods to the vicious raids by the Horde of Elemental Evil in years past; others veterans of the Battle of Emridy Meadows some thirteen years past, who were left disabled and cast aside once the foe was routed; or adventurers left scarred and broken by the horrors of the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, which they delved into in effort to end the Horde's so-called \"Second Rising\" only a few years ago. They tend to settle near the town's docks, the most likely place for them to find shelter, work, or passage to better opportunity. Whatever the reason for their poverty, the arrogantly classist citizenry of Verbobonc try to overlook and ignore these destitute folk, leaving them to fend for themselves. Even the church of St. Cuthbert, so powerful in these lands, is more focused on stomping out evil than caring for the needy. As such, the poor and forgotten of Verbobonc have banded together, forging a strong comradery amongst themselves, working together and caring for each other's well-being. The epitome of this communal assistance is a man named Virianis Dast (NG Baklunish human commoner , he/him). Once a merchant and trader of significant respect, Virianis watched as his business died at the hands of the Horde's raids, eventually leaving him entirely bankrupt. He wasn't the first for this to happen to, and far from the last, but over time his cool head, humbleness, and kindness earned him no little respect as a mediator among the needy of Verbobonc, and a representative between them and the rest of the city. With his former connections among the Viscounty's merchant class and knack for logistics he also became something of a coordinator of how the community's resources are put to use. His position as a de facto leader of those living in poverty has earned him various titles, such as \"the Beggar King,\" or \"the Suffering Sultan.\" These were used derisively by the city at large but eventually accepted with some humor by Dast and his community. Even though he is later in his years, Virianis Dast spends much of his time moving about the city, mostly around the docks, checking on and catching up with the people of his community, asking after their concerns and making sure their needs are taken care of. Other times he can be found in a backroom of a particular warehouse down by the docks, the last remaining part of his old business that he has somehow managed to hold onto. The main space he shares with those who need it, offering them much-needed shelter, and in the back he makes his own quarters, meets with anyone who wishes to speak to him, and plans with others how to best distribute the community's resources. Virianis is rarely far from his \"honor guard\", rotating pairs of local teens (any non-evil alignment, any race thugs , any pronouns) who have taken it upon themselves to assist and protect him at all times. He has never asked them to do this, but allows them to do so and appreciates them immensely, he is very fond of them all.

O: I'll make sure it's dealt with. The \"Castle\" TODO Return to Halmadar's Tomb The party may be eager to set out to the Kron Hills in search of Halmadar's Tomb, even if they don't know that this was where the Circle of Eight fell, their research all but certainly points to it as the next step on the archmages' trail. If they attempt to do so, the burial mound is not easy to find. When the Circle of Eight searched for it, the divination blackout was still weak enough in this region that they were able to rely on magic to locate it, a luxury no longer available to the player characters. Instead, they might locate the tomb by other means, such as: Finding and getting the help of the same guide that the Circle of Eight hired to take them into the hills. He might not know exactly where the mound is but might be able to lead the party to where he and the wizards parted ways. Simply setting out into the hills and following Halmadar's trail of destruction back to its source. Being lead there by the gnomes of Osnabr\u00f6lt, Halmadar's entombment was only 130-some years ago, many of the gnomes there were alive at the time and even participated in its construction. This option is best saved for if the party only think to seek out the tomb after they have gone to Osnabr\u00f6lt in the later chapter. Or another approach at the DM's discretion. See Book 2, Chapter 1 for more information on venturing into the Kron Hills. Arriving at the tomb, the party finds the aftermath of the Circle of Eight's investigation of it. Roughly a month has passed since then. Little has changed since the prologue , except as described below: The stonework is substantially more cracked, and the ceilings are crumbling in places. If the Circle cleared the roots from the entranceway, they are still cleared but are beginning to grow back. The outer seal is open, even if the Circle did not leave it open. The aftermath of the battle and investigation in the Vaulted Chamber is evident. The spaces where the defeated statues fell are now difficult terrain. If any of the 6 statues did not animate to attack the Circle of Eight, those remaining do now and attack the party. Instead of stone golems the remaining statues might be reduced-threat stone golems (half the normal hit point maximum and takes a \u22122 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs). The wretched living in the bottom of the pit are still there if the Circle did not destroy them. The inner seal is destroyed, even if the Circle found a way through without destroying it. In Halmadar's Prison they find the rotting corpses of the Circle of Eight, not necessarily in the exact places they fell. The ones that had their bones turned to jelly by the Hand of Vecna are very difficult to identify. The very old ouroboros painted in blood on the floor has been completed with the eye-in-hand symbol of Vecna in much fresher blood. After recovering Halmadar out in the hills, the cultists of Vecna returned here to do this and to loot the bodies. The wizards' most powerful magic items were all stolen, but it is possible that some of the more minor items went unnoticed or ignored. While exploring the room, the party might find that they are not alone. Some ideas for what might be in there with them are: There are still one or more sorrowsworn hidden in the refuse around the room, such as the lonely . A young deep dragon recently burrowed up into the tomb from below now that the wards have failed, intending to make its lair there, and claim the Circle's remaining items as the beginning of its hoard. It has either hidden itself in the detritus around the chamber or is down in the tunnels below when the party first enter. The adventurers might think to defeat it to claim its hoard, but if they instead parley with it they could gain themselves a useful ally and an opportunity to barter for some of the contents in the hoard The Cult Acts Once Oaklin has set the party on the path towards the quarry, if he is not accompanying them, after he reports in to the cult leadership, (TODO: Either the Thought or the Heart) summons an invisible stalker named Cochort to tail them The Rock Powder Inn Like 6 hours out from Verbobonc on foot?

Aftermath Victory Defeat Level Advancement The characters advance from 6th to 7th level after the events at the quarry, or if they discover the location of the cult while avoiding it entirely. Beryn Talkin advances in level, becoming a 6th-level spellcaster. This gives him an additional 3rd level spell slot (for a total of three) and he gains the spell vampiric touch . Additionally, he gains the Inescapable Destruction feature, allowing necrotic damage dealt by his cleric spells and Divine Eminence to ignore resistance to necrotic damage.","title":"Ch. 5: Verbobonc"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#chapter-5-verbobonc","text":"Upon arriving in Verbobonc, the party's priority should be locating the cultists there. If they have ensured the Avrel they will track the cult to help regain his clan's reputation, or followed the information from Almarth that this is where he brought the cultists to Greyhawk from, this should be clear to them. But if they are fixated on the vague news they have from Osnabr\u00f6lt or on the fate of the Circle of Eight, are confused, or are too focused on some other direction, they can be nudged in the right direction if required. If Turim is with the party and has either been told or somehow else found out that the party is seeking the Cult of Vecna, he immediately and very conspicuously begins asking around about the cult. It is in his best interest to do so, since even alerting the cult will help him find them and claim his rightful position as the Voice of Vecna . This very quickly ensures that not only the cult, but other power groups in the city are aware of the party and their search. If the party travelled with Yagos ~~and are aware of his status as a cultist~~, he tells them that he will arrange a meeting with a contact of his within the cult that can get them to the temple in the city. The contact in question is Oaklin . If allowed to meet privately, they make plans for Yagos to take the party to the Rock Powder Inn where they will rendezvous with Oaklin, who will then lead them to an ambush at the quarry at night, under the pretense of it being a cult ceremony and the party arriving as new inductees. If the two aren't allowed to converse in private, Yagos will meet Oaklin with any party members who wish to be present, and introduce them to Oaklin as potential new disciples. Yagos will attempt to secretly convey to Oaklin that they are actually enemies of the cult and need to be dealt with, his deception can be seen through by making a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by Yagos' Charisma (Deception) check. Characters who do not know thieves' cant make the check at disadvantage, and may be unable determine the actual meaning of the coded exchange. If the secret message is able to go by unnoticed and uninterrupted, Oaklin sets up the same plan as if the two of them were able to meet alone. revision note: Yagos will play this slightly differently if he is known to be a cultist, or if he is acting as if he only knows about the cult and is acting out of fear of them. If the party arrived with the Rhennee fleet and Yagos has not been outed, he secretly informed the Cult of the party and their investigation. This makes its way up the cult structure in Verbobonc, then the Thought of the Organ dispatched one of their top operatives to tail them: the leader of the Fingers in Verbobonc, Oaklin the Half-Elf","title":"Chapter 5: Verbobonc"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#news-from-kieren","text":"Whenever the party determines that they are in a safe location to do so, they can contact Kieren with a sending as indicated they should do when they were in transit. When they do so, if the sending stone was used, they might be surprised that the response comes in Mordenkainen's voice: Have to trust your determination of security, we cannot scry you. Wait. We will be making contact shortly, this is a complex ritual. If Kieren is specifically targeted with a sending spell, she conveys something similar in her own manner. Alternate Approach (for my game, will probably cut from final) Option: Instead, Mordenkainen's response is I have arranged a meeting with the Bishop, he will be providing aid. Go to the Cathedral of St. Cuthbert, tell them Mordenkainen sent you. When they do so, the characters are brought in by the priests (who were given descriptions of the party) to the Bishop's private garden. On a table is an assortment of finger foods. A few moments later the Bishop and Alimora come in. Once basic introductions are complete, the Bishop puts on a ring similar to the one that Kieren wore in Chapter 2, signaling to Mordenkainen that they are gathered, and the scene proceeds as below. Projected images of Mordenkainen and Kieren appear to the characters, meanwhile the two of them and Ravel Dasinder are in the peak of the pyramid that contains the Greyhawk University of Magical Arts.

By the source being within its borders, the Empire of Iuz must have noticed and subsequently tracked and found the source faster The other was in southern Keoland, where Mordenkainen found it (maybe in the Dreadwood?) Site was a ruined temple, serpent and eye-in-hand imagery were prevalent, indicates cult connection and longevity In the temple, found a stone tablet that seems to be the specific source of the blackout Moving the tablet from the temple moved the blackout epicenter with it The tablet appears to describe some sort of ritual, it's imbued with extremely powerful magic, and is as old as it and the temple seem It's difficult to tell for sure, all divination magic fails too close to it, so spells like identify are useless Relying on mundane observation and research instead [Our campaign specific] This was confirmed by a second opinion from a contact of Nystul's in the church of Bleredd, who was also reached by the vision of the Circle falling Mordenkainen brought her to Verbobonc to meet them, she is waiting at the temple of Saint Cuthbert The Bishop insists on knowing about the cult investigation, he has invited the party to lunch (whenever that makes sense to be) For now, he has taken the tablet to his citadel in the Yatil Mountains for study, which has lessened the blackout over Greyhawk","title":"News from Kieren"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#the-city","text":"City slogan: \"Earth and Stone, Man and Gnome\" His Noble Lordship, the Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc (LG Oeridian human noble or veteran , he/him) Despite substantial mineral riches and significant trade power bringing much affluence to the Viscounty, not all of the region's residents are advantaged by this wealth, especially in the town of Verbobonc itself. Many were once caravaneers who lost their livelihoods to the vicious raids by the Horde of Elemental Evil in years past; others veterans of the Battle of Emridy Meadows some thirteen years past, who were left disabled and cast aside once the foe was routed; or adventurers left scarred and broken by the horrors of the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, which they delved into in effort to end the Horde's so-called \"Second Rising\" only a few years ago. They tend to settle near the town's docks, the most likely place for them to find shelter, work, or passage to better opportunity. Whatever the reason for their poverty, the arrogantly classist citizenry of Verbobonc try to overlook and ignore these destitute folk, leaving them to fend for themselves. Even the church of St. Cuthbert, so powerful in these lands, is more focused on stomping out evil than caring for the needy. As such, the poor and forgotten of Verbobonc have banded together, forging a strong comradery amongst themselves, working together and caring for each other's well-being. The epitome of this communal assistance is a man named Virianis Dast (NG Baklunish human commoner , he/him). Once a merchant and trader of significant respect, Virianis watched as his business died at the hands of the Horde's raids, eventually leaving him entirely bankrupt. He wasn't the first for this to happen to, and far from the last, but over time his cool head, humbleness, and kindness earned him no little respect as a mediator among the needy of Verbobonc, and a representative between them and the rest of the city. With his former connections among the Viscounty's merchant class and knack for logistics he also became something of a coordinator of how the community's resources are put to use. His position as a de facto leader of those living in poverty has earned him various titles, such as \"the Beggar King,\" or \"the Suffering Sultan.\" These were used derisively by the city at large but eventually accepted with some humor by Dast and his community. Even though he is later in his years, Virianis Dast spends much of his time moving about the city, mostly around the docks, checking on and catching up with the people of his community, asking after their concerns and making sure their needs are taken care of. Other times he can be found in a backroom of a particular warehouse down by the docks, the last remaining part of his old business that he has somehow managed to hold onto. The main space he shares with those who need it, offering them much-needed shelter, and in the back he makes his own quarters, meets with anyone who wishes to speak to him, and plans with others how to best distribute the community's resources. Virianis is rarely far from his \"honor guard\", rotating pairs of local teens (any non-evil alignment, any race thugs , any pronouns) who have taken it upon themselves to assist and protect him at all times. He has never asked them to do this, but allows them to do so and appreciates them immensely, he is very fond of them all.","title":"The City"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#gnomeburg","text":"Miral Cutterfro (NG rock gnome commoner , she/her) Larossa ~~Baru~~ Tomenook (CG stout halfling commoner or bard , she/her) 4 Sons: Alston","title":"Gnomeburg"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#searching","text":"His Holiness, Bishop Haufren of Saint Cuthbert (LN Oeridian human war priest , he/him) Provost of the City, Her Prominence Rollei Augustin (LN Suloise human noble , she/her) The Right Honorable Sir Alfentrask (LG Oeridian half-orc knight , they/them) Gentlefolk of the Watch (LN/LG/N/NG various guards ) The first morning the party wakes in Verbobonc once the cult knows of their presence, they find a finger hanging on their door.
