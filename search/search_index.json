Archways can have one of three states: Static: No magical activity, normal stone archway Charged: Some magical activity. May exhibit some special effect. Can be upgraded to Active with cult ritual. Active: Significant magical activity. May exhibit some additional special effect. Form connections to Tovag parallels. Charged and active archways can be identified with detect magic . They primarily register as conjuration magic, but some may also give off divination (e.g. ones that have magnifying or scrying effects) or illusion (e.g. just colours or unspecific visual effects) if appropriate. Using detect magic to differentiate active archways from charged ones is initially a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check, but the DC decreases each time it is attempted: -4 each time it is succeeded, and -2 each time it is failed and then differentiation is managed through other means. Aside from the archways that have to be connected in order to maintain the network described in the book, ones that are charged with effects that make some logical sense are described below, as well as some for variety and misdirection.

She is currently under the command of Druelnarg (area 6), but he gives her some degree of independence. She has a pet gorgon on a leash named Nogrog, or \"Noggy\" 6 other mercenaries (human veterans , various pronouns) 1 is sitting by the fire, chatting with Saranay 1 is sitting by the fire, chatting with 2 others in 10a 2 are at the far end of 10a, chatting with the hobgoblins in 11 Overseeing holding off the nothics from 13, and the search for the Book of Vile Darkness in 12 11. Head Librarian ~~See area 24 in book.~~ Basically nothing from the book still stands. Changed Description This chamber was once a well-appointed private room. Some tapestries grace the wall, it's evident that more did previously, and crystal lamps hang from the ceiling. A secret passageway has been opened in one of the walls, and all the room's furnishings, including a bed, an armoire, a mirror, and a small desk, have been arranged around it, though don't entirely block it. A pair of armed hobgoblins guard the opening, while a third one tends to their equipment. See notes for area 13. Iuzites keeping this passage open and guarded to stop nothics from finding the door to area 12 instead Essentially built chokepoint/funnel out of old furniture to make it easier to kill them when they come through Hobgoblins currently reporting to Saranay, but are under Druelnarg's command Hobgoblins will only join fight in 10/10a when things are going very badly, otherwise will stay on their posts 12. Archive of Secrets See area 25 in book. Floor is all difficult terrain due to mess Dopa Nu'Larseen, human cleric of Iuz, he/him Use Beryn's old stat block if needed but only up to 2nd level spells because Iuz is in Ravenloft In addition to stress at losing his spells, he is being hounded by an allip that no one else has encountered Secret door to area 12 requires DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, classic hidden bookshelf door deal Secret door to area 14 requires DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check and can only be opened with a consecrated Vecnan holy symbol carried by a cultist of Memory rank or higher (other magical means can also work) Successful perception check reveals where to insert the symbol as part of finding the door as a \"strange indentation\", determining its purpose and what needs to be inserted requires DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check Within accessible area of temple, only Ignassi's holy symbol is sufficient 13. Secret Passage An unlit, secret passage connecting areas 11, 12, and 15. When the Iuzite assault became dire, the Vecnan librarian Thalifon Burset opened the doors to area 15 in an attempt to draw out Nothic reinforcements. The door to area 15 was broken open and cannot be closed. In order to keep the Nothics from noticing the door to area 12, the Iuzites are keeping the door to area 11 open but barricaded and guarded, to draw them that way instead. 14. Compendium Maleficarum See area 26 in book. Trap still present even with lock on door. Need holy symbol and password to get in safely DC 18 Constitution saving throw Success: 1d4 necrotic damage Failure: 10d10 necrotic damage (or 2d10 per round for 5 rounds) In the room is the Book of Vile Darkness , while it looks different, characters can tell that its the same book as the manuscript they found in the Shadowed Room. 15. Deep Reach See area 27 in book. Instead of being somewhere where cultists would call up \"emissaries from evil powers\", the tunnels lead to a cave network where the \"Spawn of Vecna\" ( nothics ) live. 16. Empty See area 28 in book. See notes on the Spawn of Vecna . When a cultist begins to turn into a nothic, they are brought here, then escape into the tunnels of area 15. It's not always because of reading the Book of Vile Darkness (in fact, few are allowed to). 17. Bindery See area 29 in book. Some unprocessed \"leather\" may attack as 6 boneless 18. Observation Chamber See area 30 in book. 4 nothics instead of ghouls Lever next to the wheel: Turns on ghoul-lights in area 20 19. Festlock See area 31 in book. 20. Newcomer's Field See area 32 in book. Lights are off unless lever in area 18 was activated, room is dark except dim area near window Combat: Wave 1 (round 1): 4 zombies , 4 skeletons , 1 gallows speaker Gallows speaker is barely visible at distance. Use to draw party deeper into room. Doesn't attack until they're close Wave 2 (round 2): 4 zombies , 2 greater zombies Wave 3 (round 3 or 4): 2 zombie clots 21. Hallway? (TODO: Make a better name) 2 Teeth lying in wait for anyone coming out of area 5 (see area 5 notes) 22. Workshops Small forge Area for making casting foci Large bench space dedicated to making knucklebones of channeling etc. 23. Storage Mostly storage for workshops Materials and manufactured items Magic items: shortsword +2 driftglobe 2x potion of healing, greater Secret door to 25b requires DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check, because of all the clutter 24. Summoning Room Room used by cultists for summoning rituals 5 nothics have gotten in and are trying to carry out some sort of ritual using the corpses of a human Vecnan cultist and an Iuzite orog 25. Empty??? See area 43 in book. No pit trap. 26. Reliquary of the Head See area 44 in book. Run as-is. Even though I'm getting rid of the lesser relics, this is a classic bit and the players should get to experience it. 27. Residential Access 3 Fingers and 1 Tooth lying in wait for anyone coming out of area 5 (see area 5 notes) 28. Teeth and Fingers See area 45 in book. On top of the handful in areas 21 and 27, there are 2 more Fingers ( master thieves ) and 3 more Teeth ( masters of souls ) still living here, who are in rooms These dorms could sleep 80+, but were never at full capacity with many living at the town in the previous Tovag parallel, but many of those that were here were wiped out in the attack 29. Chapel See area 46 in book. No ghouls. Instead, the room is in major disarray but still in use by the remaining cultists. 2 Disciples worshipping when players arrive unless they noticed nearby combat and joined in. 30. Disciples See area 47 in book. 3 Disciples (new statblock) in southeast-most room: Buliard, Leila, and Morda Sash. Only Morda has a knucklebone of channeling Same room has a glyph of warding on the lintel: 5d8 cold in a 20' radius when a creature not sworn to Vecna approaches the door. Does not affect cultists. DC 18 Dex save for half. Information they know is the same, except ignore the last point 31. Ugwaerel's Chamber See area 48 in book. Glyph or warding on the door noticeable without a check, triggers when door is opened by creature not sworn to Vecna. 5d8 lightning damage, DC 18 Ignassi is a Priest of Osybus without soul tattoo abilities for now (NOTE: If there's time before next session, make a better stat block for him!!!) The letter. Mistress Malcinex, More new bodies are coming around, got some real cutters hearing us now. Good news after we had to put a couple namers in the dead-book for rattling their bone-boxes overmuch. Pentar's already peery someone's playing mimir on the Doomguard. She's well-lanned but I don't think she's onto us and we're ready to give her the laugh if need be. Chant is some big shake's brewing in the cage before long, we might need to bolt anyway. We folded the Armory like you asked, ready for you all to call kip when the time comes. Mark the blue door with our symbol over a raven's skull, it opens to a channeling knucklebone. Ely Cromlich (Okay, if it's a \"faction of... the Doomguard\" then it doesn't make sense that it's coming from Pentar. I think it's pretty out of character if it did come from Pentar, so I'm going to say it was Cromlich.) 32. Latrines 33. Commissary 49 34. Kitchen 50 35. Wine Storage 51 36. Cold Storage 52 37. Dry Storage 53 38. Atrium See area 54 in book. Change: Presenting the Book of Vile Darkness to the doors can allow the entire entire party to pass through. The doors don't open, they just become transparent and incorporeal. Room full of dead from battle representing both sides Bodies all looted, obvious that they have been disturbed Two fonts on eastern wall on either side of door. One completely dried out, one contains 1 vials worth of unholy water Faint mechanical noises can be heard from southern passage 39. Gauntlet of the Eye See area 55 in book. 40. The Machine See area 56 in book. Broken machinery is source of noises heard from area 38. 41. Reliquary of the Eye See area 57 in book. DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check to find Iuz's discarded eyeball. 42. Gauntlet of the Hand See area 58 and 59 in book. Use iron golem stat block. If not feeling like doing combat: just have it stand there menacingly and decide that it only attacks those attempting to leave with the Hand. Door Trap. DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) to notice Cannot be disabled by nonmagical means, requires dispel magic If door opened without trap being disabled, all creatures who can see the door are targeted by enemies abound DC 16 Intelligence saving throw Disabled golem is not a valid target for attacks while under effect Spell trap makes creature see whatever it would consider an enemy in the door reflection, for the party this would be agents of Vecna, thereby encouraging the use of the Swords of Kas 43. Horrors of Midnights See area 59 and 60 in book. Room Trap. Characters with Passive Perception 13 or higher think to look up and notice ceiling features without having to explicitly say they look up Characters with Passive Perception 15 or higher notice markings on the floor in the entrance doorway DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) determines that markings are from people repeatedly kneeling in that spot Checking a Book of Pain turns up instructions on how to disable all the traps in this room (kneel and say \"Vecna grants us safe passage through the rain of death. All hail Vecna!\") as part of ritual involving the reliquary of the Hand. Also disables symbol on door to 44. On initiative 0 of first round with someone in the room, and every second (maybe third?) round following, trap triggers a spray of slime from ceiling Affected creatures and objects dissolve in 1d4 rounds Doubled if acid damage resistant, no danger if acid damage immune DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to strip and clean slime off body, disadvantage if trap was not noticed Slime neutralized by lesser restoration , can be removed from objects with prestidigitation Door Trap. DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) to notice symbol above door to 44 Triggers when creature crosses halfway mark through room Stunning effect: DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute Can be dispelled as 7th level spell Door requires key carried by Ugwaerel or DC 20 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to unlock 44. Reliquary of the Hand See area 60 in book. The reliquary is empty, since Ugwaerel took the hand for herself to fight off the Iuzites. Adjust description as needed. Reliquary has 3 locks, each requiring a DC 18 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to unlock, or a knock spell No point in opening it anyways, since it's visibly empty Every 4 rounds that the room is occupied by a non-Vecna-aligned creature, relief statues trigger DC 15 Charisma save to not get trapped Basically Mirror of Life Trapping, but can be countered by remove curse or stone to flesh 45. Narthex See area 61 in book. Loot: Hand of Vecna Key to area 44 door Ugwaerel's maul (deals bonus 2d6 necrotic on hit due to unholy water, 3d6 when she uses it) Knucklebone of channeling Empty potion bottles and empty wineskin NOTE: If still doing a public release version, need to make a buffed up version of Ugwaerel with the Hand. She just finishes attaching it to herself on the altar when party enters. 46. Nave See area 62 in book. 4 ogre bolt launchers on far side, each anchored to the far wall by their own 10 ft. chain Anti-magic barrier. Plane across middle of room acts as anti-magic barrier Effectively, anything crossing the barrier is treated as if entering the area of an antimagic field spell Glyph creating the field can be noticed with DC 18 Wisdom (Perception), and can be dispelled as if it was an 8th level spell but only from the far side of the chasm 47. Apse See area 63 in book. No blade barrier at entrance, disabled by Iuzites Ignore all Iuzites present in book, instead present are: Beryn Talkin (new updated stat block) Can't use spells above 2nd level since Iuz passed through portal Festnarg ( hobgoblin warlord , he/him), half-brother of Druelnarg from area 6, second in command 4 hobgoblin devastators 4 hobgoblins Rest went through portal","title":"Ch. 2: The Temple of Vecna"},{"location":"dvd/2-the-temple-of-vecna/#chapter-2-the-temple-of-vecna","text":"The Compendium Maleficarum is the original Book of Vile Darkness Other books of vile darkness found later are maybe reproductions?

Powers still mostly work but are mediated by the Dark Powers with some modifications: Divination spells of 3rd level or higher fail vague whether this is the Powers or an effect similar to the Divination Blackout, surrounding the events transpiring Alignment-detecting magic and abilities only detect law/chaos, not good/evil All undead have advantage against being turned Arcane casters: Divination spells of 5th level or higher fail No spells or ability allow leaving the plane Spells that create extradimensional spaces fail Magic items that create extradimensional spaces still work, but are difficult to use i.e. can't use bag of holding in battle Vecna can intercept and answer any spells attempting to contact a being outside of the domain Summoned creatures don't get to leave Necromancy spells are twice as effective Vecna's Domain in the Demiplane Vecna, and now Iuz in addition, represents more power than the Demiplane of Dread and its Dark Powers are used to containing, which is why some things work differently than normal in Ravenloft Despite only having been here for a few months from the party's perspective, time weirdness with the Demiplane and the Dark Powers have made it so Cavitius has been here for untold years Cavitius: The Domain The domain is a vast dust desert and the only settlement is Citadel Cavitius, the only road is the one that leads from the gate of the Citadel to the Burning Peaks Across the Burning Peaks (through the Mists) is Tovag, the (supposed?) domain of Kas, with which Cavitius is in eternal war Currently, Vecna has put the Domain on lockdown, the Mists are thick and closed in within view of the Citadel, though are slightly farther out along the road The main gate of the Citadel is closed and is all but unopenable Other ways out of the Citadel exist, but not the focus of this adventure The deserts are wandered/patrolled by nightwalkers , out in force because of the lockdown No longer life-draining inherently Kas The citizens of Cavitius know of Kas as the traitorous lieutenant of Vecna who betrayed him and led to the destruction of the ancient empire. If asked where he is now they would know that he is ruling a Domain of his own across the mountains, with which they are forever at war with, and invasion forces are regularly sent back and forth across the range. Almost every person in the Citadel has either served in Vecna's army, or has lost family and loved ones to Kas' forces. It is left vague whether Kas is truly ruling his own Domain across the mountains at this point, just as Kas' fate has been left vague for this entire campaign. Maybe the Dark Powers did get him, or some part of him, and put him there, or maybe there's nothing out there at all and it is all part of the Dark Powers' scheme to keep Vecna busy for as long as they could, forming armies out of the Mists to fight Vecna's forces. However, many also know that Kas, seeking to atone for his betrayal, returned to Vecna's side and now once again wields his mythical sword at Vecna's side, serving him as bodyguard and general as before. This is false, a fact that is only known to Vecna and a very small few of his closest advisors, that \"Kas\" was some would-be hero that acquired the Sword of Kas (Longsword) , was utterly taken over by its personality and sought to slay Vecna (as the Sword/Kas wants), but had his mind twisted and was transformed into a death knight , so he now serves Vecna. See next chapter for more on this false Kas. The people of Cavitius have no issue holding these two contradicting viewpoints in mind, they will accept whichever of the two is most relevant at any given instant, and cannot be led to see any sort of fault to it. Citadel Cavitius: City of Dread Outer skull is giant skull made of normal-sized skulls fused together All structures made of bone-like material Outdoors lit by magical lamps, only dim light A vast staircase winds around the inside of the skull to the Temple above the gate, the side of this staircase is wrought to look like a serpent Banners fly the banner of Vecna's ancient empire: The twisting black ouroboros in the center of a blood-red field A brutal windstorm whips over the Citadel, preventing flight out the top Multiple levels of city, blocks out view of the sky in some places Many roads around the main plaza where the palace is have been barricaded to hold off Iuz's forces People Mortals. ~12000 mostly humans Most transported here from the last days of Vecna's empire by the Dark Powers Some travelled here from Oerth as part of the cult, but those are in positions of at least minor authority, not just random people on the streets Speak Ancient Flan, see below Tend to be cold and distasteful, but more out for themselves and conniving than bullies (contradicting the book) Undead. ~1000 corporeal, intelligent ~1000 incorporeal, intelligent Uncounted unintelligent undead (basic zombies and skeletons and the like) Intelligent undead, primarily the corporeal ones, tend to have a higher standing than the mortals of Cavitius, as much a testament to the benefits of immortality as Vecna's favour for them Still trying to de-emphasize the undead angle of Vecna to push the secrets stuff more Removed \"Undead Lords\" as power structure from book, but many positions of authority are held by undead beings Again, mostly because immortality helps make sure you can keep rising through the ranks Language The language of Cavitius is Ancient Flan anyone who speaks modern Flan needs to make DC 23 Intelligence (History) or Wisdom (Insight) checks to understand and Charisma (Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation) to be understood Coinage Coinage in circulation uses the same cp/sp/gp denominations as the modern Oerth All coins date back to the Occluded Empire, no new minting If taken back to Oerth, coins worth 2d100 times face value Some random smatterings of coins brought from elsewhere: by cultists crossing over, or by travelers within the Demiplane of Dread Magic Vecna's control over magic (his connection to the Serpent) is so complete that normally all spells fail unless cast by those loyal to Vecna With Iuz's incursion, his hold on magic has weakened, so casting can work as normal (within the restrictions above) Normal citizens are still highly distrustful of magic and those who can wield it, or assume they are loyal to Vecna Enforcement Cavitius has an army, but it is primarily concerned with the threat of Tovag across the mountains Internally, order is maintained via two organizations: The police force (colloquially known as \"The Hands\") and the secret police (\"The Eyes\") The two groups are overseen by a skull lord commonly known as Lord Haroln, the name of their center head The Hands. A brutally effective and merciless city guard, the Hands patrol the streets and keep order with threats and violence. The rank and file are made up mostly of recruits from Cavitius, along with cultists from Oerth holding the rank of Blood, and some especially effective Fingers. (Use similar stat blocks as those cult ranks). The force is bolstered when needed (such as now) by unintelligent undead. The Eyes. A clandestine and cutthroat secret police with informants throughout Cavitius. As is befitting the Whispered One, the culture of Cavitius closely follows that of the Cult of Vecna, and the leverage of secrets and blackmail is often the only route to power. The Eyes encourage citizens to turn on each other and report on their neighbours in order to gain favour, and those who do well enough may even get to join the ranks of the secret police officially. The Eyes are fewer in number than the Hands, but only because they can rely so much on informants and snitches. Those who are fully operatives of the Eyes are Fingers and some Teeth from Oerth, and some truly exceptional natives of Cavitius. The spymasters behind them are more powerful undead, such as mind drinker vampires. The Eye (the creature, and a different one than the one the heroes last encountered) holds significant power with the surveillance apparatus, however it does not run it, nor is it under the command of the spymasters. Lord Haroln. A skull lord made up of three of Vecna's former councilors and advisors oversee much of what goes on in Citadel Cavitius. The citizenry refer to them collectively as Haroln (when they dare speak their name at all), which is only the name of the center head. The others are Sharl, and Kornast. All three of them were with Vecna at the Siege of Fleeth when he met with the city's representatives, and all three were present at the council meeting seen in the attunement flashback for the Rapier of Kas . Whoever is attuned to the Rapier would recognize them as such. (TODO: Move this to dramatis personae) Locations of Note Staircase.

An Iuzite ring of tongues is made out of one or more tongues taken from dead or captured enemies of Iuz. When worn, it can be activated as an action to cast tongues on the wearer. Activating it requires somehow moistening the tongues, which then dry out over the course of the hour the spell lasts. Amulet of Comprehending Languages Magic item, amulet, no attunement. An Iuzite amulet of comprehending languages is made out of one or more stitched-together ears taken from dead or captured enemies of Iuz on a piece of cord. When worn, it can he activated as an action to cast comprehend languages on the wearer, but only to translate what the wearer hears. If questioned, the giant knows little, but the witches know the following (replacing bullet points in book): Iuz and his forces have been here for 2 or 3 days, it is hard to tell without a daylight cycle (it is obvious to the heroes that time passes differently here than on Oerth) Iuz is currently on the front lines, laying siege to the Palace of Vecna (which they point out, easily visible: four sleek black towers and a fifth larger one in their center). Once he gets inside and gets to Vecna, he will \"consume\" the other demigod Even if he fails to consume Vecna, Iuz is certain that by wielding both the Sword of Kas (which she knows Iuz has from Tycheron) and the Eye of Vecna, he can kill Vecna Most of Iuz's forces are involved in the siege of the Palace, others are holding the Keep, and a handful are out on the street being disruptive The natives speak a language that the Iuzites don't know, so Iuz had some of his necromancers prepare the rings and amulets to help Getting to the Palace Underground Boring, probably won't even present as an option But if they do, it's full of nothics instead of ghouls Along the Streets / Across the Rooftops If across rooftops, modify encounters to balconies, stairwells, etc. The Doomed Same as book except talking is fine, just no touch The Devoted Same as book with new stat blocks: Memory : Priest of Osybus without soul tattoo abilities Bodyguards : 2 Disciples of Vecna Reavers : 4 Nightveil Specters initially without mounts The Demented Same as book, focus roleplay. \"Hands\" instead of \"Fingers\", use 4x veteran and 1x champion Valuriss is a spy with some sort of foresight ability The Desperate Same as book, except don't use \"Arm of Vecna\" as title. Instead of encountering Haroln themselves as part of this, they encounter a mind drinker vampire spymaster from the Eyes. Calls them out for being outsiders Admits vampirism Probably even admits being part of the Eyes Is there on behalf of Haroln for the same reasons as in the book The Destroyers Pretty much same as book, reword boxed text so that it's not implied that Iuz knows about the heroes specifically. Also make clear that the kids are fine Kelleth of Greyhawk: CE, human Black Gauntlet of Bane , he/him, knows Beryn well (Beryn was always more of the infiltrator, Kelleth more of a traditional priest of Iuz) Bear: CE, human Champion , she/her Geral Kher: CE, half-elf evoker wizard , they/them Lanner Hvist: CE, human blackguard , he/him Karhk: CE, orc war chief , he/him Bunch of orcs If reavers get involved (too easy or fight needs to be broken up), they use nightveil specter stats as above The Drifters Perceptive members of the party who are familiar with the ways of the Rhennee can spot some familiar markings near an alleyway. Following these hidden guides lead to finding a hidden group of mostly-humans hiding in an abandoned building that can't be entered except by the marked way. They, and the home they have set up for themselves, appear similar to Rhennee, except slightly different (and obviously not on boats) If the word \"Rhennee\" is used, they claim that it is their word for river, not the name of their people They are Vistani, nomads/wanderers of the Mists/Demiplane of Dread The Vistani are immediately extremely apprehensive and border on hostility, but can be put at ease with the party's familiarity with Rhennee culture This (smallish) group of Vistani where travelling through the domain when it became too dangerous to leave, and have been hiding out here for a couple days now They represent a safe place to stay and a source of non-Vecnan or Iuzite information within the city This is all just part of my headcanon that the Rhennee are an offshoot of the Vistani that got stranded on Oerth.","title":"Ch. 4: Citadel Cavitius"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#chapter-4-citadel-cavitius","text":"","title":"Chapter 4: Citadel Cavitius"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#special-rules-in-cavitius","text":"The domain is on lockdown, making some rules stricter than normal Divine casters feel separated from their gods.

The people of Cavitius have no issue holding these two contradicting viewpoints in mind, they will accept whichever of the two is most relevant at any given instant, and cannot be led to see any sort of fault to it.","title":"Cavitius: The Domain"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#citadel-cavitius-city-of-dread","text":"Outer skull is giant skull made of normal-sized skulls fused together All structures made of bone-like material Outdoors lit by magical lamps, only dim light A vast staircase winds around the inside of the skull to the Temple above the gate, the side of this staircase is wrought to look like a serpent Banners fly the banner of Vecna's ancient empire: The twisting black ouroboros in the center of a blood-red field A brutal windstorm whips over the Citadel, preventing flight out the top Multiple levels of city, blocks out view of the sky in some places Many roads around the main plaza where the palace is have been barricaded to hold off Iuz's forces","title":"Citadel Cavitius: City of Dread"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#people","text":"Mortals. ~12000 mostly humans Most transported here from the last days of Vecna's empire by the Dark Powers Some travelled here from Oerth as part of the cult, but those are in positions of at least minor authority, not just random people on the streets Speak Ancient Flan, see below Tend to be cold and distasteful, but more out for themselves and conniving than bullies (contradicting the book) Undead. ~1000 corporeal, intelligent ~1000 incorporeal, intelligent Uncounted unintelligent undead (basic zombies and skeletons and the like) Intelligent undead, primarily the corporeal ones, tend to have a higher standing than the mortals of Cavitius, as much a testament to the benefits of immortality as Vecna's favour for them Still trying to de-emphasize the undead angle of Vecna to push the secrets stuff more Removed \"Undead Lords\" as power structure from book, but many positions of authority are held by undead beings Again, mostly because immortality helps make sure you can keep rising through the ranks","title":"People"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#language","text":"The language of Cavitius is Ancient Flan anyone who speaks modern Flan needs to make DC 23 Intelligence (History) or Wisdom (Insight) checks to understand and Charisma (Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation) to be understood","title":"Language"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#coinage","text":"Coinage in circulation uses the same cp/sp/gp denominations as the modern Oerth All coins date back to the Occluded Empire, no new minting If taken back to Oerth, coins worth 2d100 times face value Some random smatterings of coins brought from elsewhere: by cultists crossing over, or by travelers within the Demiplane of Dread","title":"Coinage"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#magic","text":"Vecna's control over magic (his connection to the Serpent) is so complete that normally all spells fail unless cast by those loyal to Vecna With Iuz's incursion, his hold on magic has weakened, so casting can work as normal (within the restrictions above) Normal citizens are still highly distrustful of magic and those who can wield it, or assume they are loyal to Vecna","title":"Magic"},{"location":"dvd/4-citadel-cavitius/#enforcement","text":"Cavitius has an army, but it is primarily concerned with the threat of Tovag across the mountains Internally, order is maintained via two organizations: The police force (colloquially known as \"The Hands\") and the secret police (\"The Eyes\") The two groups are overseen by a skull lord commonly known as Lord Haroln, the name of their center head The Hands. A brutally effective and merciless city guard, the Hands patrol the streets and keep order with threats and violence. The rank and file are made up mostly of recruits from Cavitius, along with cultists from Oerth holding the rank of Blood, and some especially effective Fingers. (Use similar stat blocks as those cult ranks). The force is bolstered when needed (such as now) by unintelligent undead. The Eyes. A clandestine and cutthroat secret police with informants throughout Cavitius. As is befitting the Whispered One, the culture of Cavitius closely follows that of the Cult of Vecna, and the leverage of secrets and blackmail is often the only route to power. The Eyes encourage citizens to turn on each other and report on their neighbours in order to gain favour, and those who do well enough may even get to join the ranks of the secret police officially. The Eyes are fewer in number than the Hands, but only because they can rely so much on informants and snitches. Those who are fully operatives of the Eyes are Fingers and some Teeth from Oerth, and some truly exceptional natives of Cavitius. The spymasters behind them are more powerful undead, such as mind drinker vampires. The Eye (the creature, and a different one than the one the heroes last encountered) holds significant power with the surveillance apparatus, however it does not run it, nor is it under the command of the spymasters. Lord Haroln. A skull lord made up of three of Vecna's former councilors and advisors oversee much of what goes on in Citadel Cavitius. The citizenry refer to them collectively as Haroln (when they dare speak their name at all), which is only the name of the center head. The others are Sharl, and Kornast. All three of them were with Vecna at the Siege of Fleeth when he met with the city's representatives, and all three were present at the council meeting seen in the attunement flashback for the Rapier of Kas .

While attuned to the artifact, your strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. (In addition to the base 20 of the Hand, for a minimum of 22) While attuned to the artifact, you deal 1d6 necrotic damage to any plant you touch that isn\u2019t a creature. The Eye of Vecna While attuned to the artifact, you can\u2019t be charmed or frightened. While attuned to the artifact, you can\u2019t be blinded, deafened, petrified, or stunned. While attuned to the artifact, you gain the following flaw: \"I show a violent temper whenever anyone disagrees with a theory I posit.\" The Swords of Kas mB MB While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact. It is unclear how much of the personality is that of the Sword's own and how much is Kas'. It is probably a mix of both as they bled into each other over Kas' time wielding it, and then mixed more thoroughly when Kas was destroyed and when the Sword was split. Greatsword Location: Osnabr\u00f6lt Aspect: The Destroyer, Kas as warrior and bodyguard. Brutal, bloodthirsty, ferocious. Attunement You are Kas, Kas the Destroyer. When you are not at Lord Vecna's side protecting his life with your own, you are the tip of his spear, leading the charge of his dread hordes and war wizards against his enemies. Fear grips even the mightiest heroes of Good when you step onto the battlefield, for they know that the approach of Lord Vecna's champion is the approach of death itself. His gift to you, the greatsword in your hands, is an instrument of glorious destruction: it sails through the air with grace and ease, and turns everything around you into bloody carnage. The siege of Fleeth drags on ever longer, too long. This is not the first assault you have lead against the ancient city's high, gleaming walls and it won't be the last, but this time is no ordinary attack. Displeased by the lack of progress made in capturing his former home, Lord Vecna himself, along with a cadre of his most powerful arcanists, intends to breach those legendary walls. He will reveal to the Fleethans the power of The Serpent, you, and the forces surrounding you on the field of battle, must get him there. With a spray of gore, your blade cleaves through the abdomen of a Fleethan templar. His blood paints the stark white armour of the other two champions with a splash of scarlet as they bring their blades down on you. Encounter. On the battle-wrought plains outside the walls of the long-besieged city of Fleeth, the sun above is blotted out by dark magic. As Vecna's army engages Fleeth's defenders all around, Kas the Destroyer faces down two champions anointed by the church of Pholtus which holds sway within the city. Having dispatched Fleeth's most zealous and formidable warriors, you turn back to your master. The Undying King watches impassively from the low ridge you leapt from to intercept the templars, refusing to even lift a finger against the feeble attacks made against him by Fleeth's defenders. His entourage of sorcerers guard him from attacks at range, and your duty as always is to ensure that no one gets close enough to attempt anything more. As you return to your place at his right you scan the battlefield around you. Conscripted soldiers, alive and undead, clash with the city's defenders while battle mages rain fire and poison onto them from afar. The winds blowing across the plain carry with them the smells of magic and death, and whip the Whispered One's robes around his skeletal body. At Lord Vecna's side stands Acererak, his longest-serving and most successful apprentice. You meet the cambion's hard stare, it is no secret amongst the inner circle that the two of you are often at odds. Encounter. Kas, Vecna, and Acererak discuss how to make the final approach to the city walls. Kas and Acererak do not get on well. Acererak believes that Kas is beneath him and undeserving of his station, meanwhile Kas is jealous of Vecna's favour for Acererak. Acererak has been in Vecna's tutalage since the cambion was 10, decades ago. Kas was never able to remove him from the equation, like he did with Narek, Vecna's previous apprentice and Kas' own son, and it has since become too late. The events with Narek occurred some time before Acererak's apprenticeship began. Acererak is a cambion archmage (TODO: throw together some stats for this). During the deliberations, a beam of radiance lances from the walls of Fleeth, targeting Vecna. It comes from Vecna's left, so from his right, Kas isn't in a position to react fast enough. Acererak is on the left, and attempts to conjure a magical barrier to protect himself and Vecna, but allows Vecna's left side to be caught in the beam. Vecna goes down, Acererak is unharmed. Acererak carries Vecna to safety after Vecna weakly orders Kas to kill those responsible. Encounter. Kas' supernatural abilities allow him to quickly close the distance to the walls of Fleeth and reach the top, whether by climbing or shapeshifting. He knows where the beam came from and is able to track the priests as they move along the battlements. Atop the walls, Kas battles three Pholtan war priests . Properties. Minor Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. Major Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Minor Detrimental: While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact. Any normal sword made to such proportions would be virtually unmanageable by a human, but the magical endowments of the Sword of Kas allow it to be handled by any warrior with grace and ease, albeit with two hands. \u2013 Vecna Lives! p. 71 Modifier: A Small or Tiny creature attuned to the Sword does not suffer disadvantage caused by the Heavy property on attack rolls made with it. Longsword Location: In the possession of the false Kas Aspect: The Bloody Handed, Kas as warlord and general. Remorseless, severe, unyielding. Attunement You are Kas, the Bloody Handed. As grand general of Lord Vecna's armies, you direct an unrelenting force of oppression and conquest that bathes the land with blood in the Whispered One's name, you order them as an extension of the Undying King's will. The well-regimented legions of slaves, soldiers, war wizards, and untold undead are at your command, waging devastating campaigns of war. Entire cities are razed, others are enslaved either for service or experimentation. No sacrifice is too great, those that fall will simply serve again in another form. His gift to you, the longsword at your side, is the emblem of your rank: representing the authority you have over thousands of blades without ever drawing your own. Gone now are the days of conquest you so enjoyed, the borders of the Occluded Empire in a state of stagnation ever since the grand campaign against Fleeth and the siege that ended it. Vecna's ambitions have turned elsewhere, immersing himself in works beyond your understanding and leaving the Empire's vast armies to wither and atrophy. Your tactical acumen and the military might it drives feel wasted on squashing puny uprisings of unwary rebels and dissidents. But recent news from the south have brought you here, around a table of maps with your most trusted generals, and a feeling that may soon change. An alliance of formerly-squabbling factions descended from refugees of the destruction of Suel, now having claimed the much of valley in the southwest from the native Flannae tribes, have been gathering forces. They have already struck north across the Empire's border several times, capturing supplies from transport caravans, and the diviners now say that they are planning a more significant offensive. Encounter. Military planning. The proto-Keolandish forces have been very effective against undead troops protecting the caravans, and they are extremely familiar with the terrain. The Empire's war wizards and trained troops are spread thin, and haven't seen serious combat in years. Encounter. One of the generals questions if Vecna has been informed of this development. Kas feels like he does not need to know, he can do this himself. Some influence from the Sword. Can pass it off as \"he doesn't need to be bothered with this.\" Properties. Minor Beneficial: While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast shield with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1\u20135, you can\u2019t cast it again until the next dawn. Major Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Minor Detrimental: While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact. War council meeting (make clearly different than Rapier scene), planning on responses to an alliance of forces in the Sheldomar Valley (who would eventually become Keoland) amassing forces for a push north into the Empire's territory, focused around Niole Dra. Shortsword Location: First seen in the possession of Iuz, recovered from the ruins of Tycheron. Aspect: The Hateful, Kas as torturer and assassin. Cruel, sadistic, vicious. Attunement You are Kas, the Hateful. Pain is your purpose, and you exercise it with delight against the enemies of your Lord Vecna. At times you are his torturer, whether twisting the flesh and minds of those who think they can hold secrets unknown to the Whispered One himself, or turning their agony to shatter and terrify their loved ones. Other times you are his assassin, plucking off figures of power and influence in the places they think themselves most safe, either making of them grizzly displays of the Undying King's wrath or ending them without the slightest hint as to who may be responsible. His gift to you, the blade in your hand, is an instrument of death: to be used as he wills it. But now you stalk through the Tower of Ykrath, its soaring height extending from the surface of a lake the bottom of which is unknown. This is where your master has sequestered himself for years, leaving you to manage every possible matter of state in his absence. You don't even know what you're doing here or how you got here, so lost were you in your own thoughts. Encounter. Kas is about to turn here. He's going to continue up this tower and try to kill Vecna. What's on his mind? A spray of blood follows your blade as you draw it back out of the body falling to the floor. Two others dressed the same back away, looks of confused recognition disappearing along with the life of their companion. One tries to call for aid, but you know this study is shielded from noise. The other tries to ready some spell. Encounter. Kas kills some of Vecna's apprentices. (Potentially these three become the deathlock wights in 2.5) Properties. Minor Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, you gain proficiency in the stealth skill. Major Beneficial: While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast hold monster with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1\u20135, you can\u2019t cast it again until the next dawn. Minor Detrimental: While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact. Rapier Location: The ruins of the Rotted Tower Aspect: The Terrible, Kas as advisor and chancellor. Tyrannical, ruthless, paranoid. Attunement You are Kas, the Terrible. For centuries you have had Lord Vecna's ear as his most trusted advisor, and the foremost among his barons. A chill is sent through even the most cunning negotiators and unflinching monarchs by your very word, for they know that the voice of Lord Vecna's regent is the voice of authority itself. His gift to you, the rapier on your hip, is a symbol of absolute dominion: it brings any dispute to an end, often without the need to draw the blade. The palace complex is surrounded by the grim sprawl of Cavitius, miles and miles of streets that you rarely walk upon in recent days. Instead, most of your time is spent within the palace proper. Day after day, you are worn down by matters of state, left to you by Vecna as he ever more regularly abdicates from his duties as ruler. The grand windows of the council chamber look out across the sea of rooftops, out towards the great lake, and to the Tower of Ykrath rising from its surface. Even now, Vecna sequesters himself there, ignoring the Empire he forged to instead delve into arcane secrets you could not begin to understand. On a raised dais, you sit at the ringed council table, in a seat that the Undying King has taken fewer than ten times since the return from the campaign against Fleeth, now several years past. Two empty seats flank you: the one on your right reserved for yourself to take whenever Vecna deigns to grant his attentions to the apparatus that keeps his vast nation running, and the one on your left intended for Acererak. It has been some time since you have seen the cambion also, ever since he departed to begin some grand project of his to the East. His continued absence more of a boon in your mind. As your dark gaze rests on the impossible tower out in the water, your thoughts hone in on Vecna's negligence, and you tighten your hold on the grip of your sword. \"Kas.\" The firm address from one of the Barons snaps your attention back to the proceedings. Encounter. Sharl (NE Flan human noble , he/him) did not offer the proper obeisance when addressing Kas. Kas' customary title is \"Lord\", even among the Barons, and while heading the council in Vecna's place it is \"Chancellor\". Unlike the Greatsword attunement, this one is a bit more freeform, since it is not combat-based. Mix these encounters together and flow them into each other as needed. Encounter. Acererak has requested an additional 10,000 undead be sent to him for use in his current work. With the Empire no longer on a campaign of conquest in recent years, that is a significant number of the ready reserves. Encounter. The secret police have been tipped off to a revolt brewing in the Northwestern territory, a decision must be made about what is to be done about it. Encounter. There is a significant food shortage in the Eastern territories. Encounter. Kas feels as if his authority is being called into question by one or more of the Barons. Whether this is true is unclear, but Kas believes it in his paranoia. Properties. Minor Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, you can\u2019t be charmed or frightened. Major Beneficial: While attuned to the artifact, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Minor Detrimental: While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. Major Detrimental: You take 4d10 psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact. (Described like the image on VL75, but without the wavy blade or unicorn horns. The one in VL is a claymore, mixing both definitions for some reason.) The True Sword of Kas Sword type (longsword, shortsword, rapier, or greatsword) is selected when the four swords are reunited. Aspect: The Betrayer. You are Kas. Kas the Destroyer. Kas the Bloody Handed. Kas the Hateful. Kas the Terrible. You are Kas of Tycheron. You are Kas the Betrayer. Nothing else you have ever done will be remembered. History will know you only as the man who struck down the greatest villain the world ever knew When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas, to act as his right hand. This despicable villain served as champion, chancellor, general, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna\u2019s admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. In life, the stories of Kas earned him many titles: The Destroyer, the Bloody-Handed, the Hateful, the Terrible. But in his death and the ages since, he has been remembered by one title above all others: The Betrayer. For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich, but as Kas\u2019s power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich\u2019s empire in Vecna\u2019s stead. Legend says Vecna\u2019s destruction came at Kas\u2019s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant\u2019s doom, leaving only Kas\u2019s sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby. The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. If the sword isn\u2019t bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 4d10 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword\u2019s demand is met. Special Properties. The True Sword of Kas has the following special properties: While attuned to the artifact, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. While attuned to the artifact, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. While attuned to the artifact, you gain proficiency in the stealth skill. While attuned to the artifact, you can\u2019t be charmed or frightened. While attuned to the artifact, your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. While attuned to the artifact, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast shield with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1\u20135, you can\u2019t cast it again until the next dawn. While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast hold monster with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1\u20135, you can\u2019t cast it again until the next dawn. While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. Spirit of Kas. While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn. Spells. While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can\u2019t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. Sentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. Personality. The sword\u2019s purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna\u2019s worshipers, destroying the lich\u2019s works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal. The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword\u2019s obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.","title":"Artifacts"},{"location":"overview/artifacts/#artifacts","text":"","title":"Artifacts"},{"location":"overview/artifacts/#the-hand-of-vecna","text":"While attuned to the artifact, you have immunity to damage from the magic missile spell.

Fear grips even the mightiest heroes of Good when you step onto the battlefield, for they know that the approach of Lord Vecna's champion is the approach of death itself. His gift to you, the greatsword in your hands, is an instrument of glorious destruction: it sails through the air with grace and ease, and turns everything around you into bloody carnage. The siege of Fleeth drags on ever longer, too long.

Aspect: The Betrayer. You are Kas. Kas the Destroyer. Kas the Bloody Handed. Kas the Hateful. Kas the Terrible. You are Kas of Tycheron. You are Kas the Betrayer. Nothing else you have ever done will be remembered. History will know you only as the man who struck down the greatest villain the world ever knew When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas, to act as his right hand. This despicable villain served as champion, chancellor, general, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna\u2019s admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. In life, the stories of Kas earned him many titles: The Destroyer, the Bloody-Handed, the Hateful, the Terrible. But in his death and the ages since, he has been remembered by one title above all others: The Betrayer. For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich, but as Kas\u2019s power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich\u2019s empire in Vecna\u2019s stead. Legend says Vecna\u2019s destruction came at Kas\u2019s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant\u2019s doom, leaving only Kas\u2019s sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby. The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. If the sword isn\u2019t bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 4d10 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword\u2019s demand is met. Special Properties. The True Sword of Kas has the following special properties: While attuned to the artifact, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. While attuned to the artifact, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. While attuned to the artifact, you gain proficiency in the stealth skill. While attuned to the artifact, you can\u2019t be charmed or frightened. While attuned to the artifact, your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. While attuned to the artifact, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast shield with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1\u20135, you can\u2019t cast it again until the next dawn. While attuned to and wielding the artifact, you can cast hold monster with it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1\u20135, you can\u2019t cast it again until the next dawn. While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. Spirit of Kas. While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn. Spells. While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can\u2019t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. Sentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. Personality. The sword\u2019s purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna\u2019s worshipers, destroying the lich\u2019s works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal. The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword\u2019s obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.","title":"The True Sword of Kas"},{"location":"overview/dramatis-personae/","text":"Dramatis Personae Diraq Malcinex Her Most Enigmatic Excellency, Sublime Mistress of the Whispered One, Diraq Malcinex of Ket is the Heart of Vecna The Eye Note: For the Eye (creature, VL) copy gaze attack from Nabassu Note 2: Stun until start of target's turn so it doesn't feel too bad.

While his name is struck from the memory of Oerth, the Cult of Vecna is never referred to as such. Instead, it is normally called the Cult of the Whispered One by the few who even know it exists. Individual cells of the cult might also use names such as the following: Followers of the Whispered One Disciples of the Hand and the Eye Maimed God's Chosen Servants of the Spider Throne Until the adventure's beginning, the cult had been biding their time and spreading their reach, but had been mostly kept in check by the Spurned Cult of Iuz, their chief rivals.

Never reveal all that you know, or your enemies will take your seed, too. \"Twice yearly they must sacrifice large quantities of magical items to Vecna.\" (VL74) Hierarchy The Voice of Vecna Short of the Whispered One himself, the Voice is the highest position in the hierarchy of the cult. As the title implies, this position may only be held by one who speaks with Vecna's voice: his manifestation. The position is left vacant until such a time as the manifestation of Vecna chooses to reveal itself to the cult. After the prologue , the rank is wrongly given to Halmadar, until things are set straight. Vecna's Manifestation While the majority of Vecna's power is trapped beyond the planes, he can gather enough of it to channel into creating a manifestation akin to a lesser avatar. Echoing his title as the Maimed God, Vecna's manifestation takes the form of a humanoid maimed in some way, usually having lost one or more limbs to violence. The manifestation can be any humanoid creature, of any age, sex, gender, or race. The appearance it takes on is usually one that will further Vecna's needs. A manifestation of Vecna has the stats of a lich , with the following changes: Its creature type is humanoid. It loses the lich's Rejuvenation and Turn Resistance abilities. Its Disrupt Life ability affects each non-undead creature within range excluding itself. It does not have a lair and cannot take lair actions. It has a Strength of 14 (+2), a Wisdom of 19 (+4), History +19, Insight +18, Perception +11, and +11 to Wisdom saving throws. It has a Passive Perception of 21. It knows all languages. It can cast the legend lore spell at will, without requiring components and without expending a spell slot. Spidered Insight. As a bonus action, the manifestation targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the manifestation's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the manifestation wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target or that the target knows. The target is not aware that this ability has been used on it. If the manifestation is destroyed, it takes 1d100 days for Vecna to gather the power to form a new one. The new manifestation may take the same or a different form as he wishes. The manifestation may have other features and abilities depending on the form it has. If the manifestation regains the Eye and Hand of Vecna, it becomes even more powerful. The Heart of Vecna With the position of the Voice often vacant or detached from the day-to-day happenings of the cult, much of the actual leadership comes down to the Heart of Vecna. The Heart is the highest member of the priesthood, and it is through the Heart that the commands of the Whispered One are put into motion by directing the cult. Traditionally, the Heart of Vecna wears unadorned blood-red robes. The current Heart of Vecna is Her Most Enigmatic Excellency, Sublime Mistress of the Whispered One, Diraq Malcinex of Ket. The Eye and the Hand Through secret rituals and flesh-warping magics, the cult turns two of their faithful into beings known as the Eye and the Hand. These powerful creatures act as the Heart's lieutenants and enforcers and as such they only answer directly to her. When required, the Eye and the Hand are sent to assist individual cells of the cult in times of need, and will unquestionably follow the cell's Thought in order to complete their mission. But every cultist knows where the creatures' loyalties lie, and fear of the Heart's wrath keeps them from being used in any attempt to further a Thought's personal ends. The Thoughts of Vecna Each cell of the cult is lead by a high priest known as a Thought. The Thoughts lead the cultists both as an apparatus to carry out the plots of the Whispered One and as a congregation in worship of him. Lesser priests of a cell are subservient to the Thought, but may turn to using threats of blackmail against their superior in bids to take their position. The sheer power of the Thought usually keeps such attempts at bay. Traditionally, Thoughts of Vecna wear black robes patterned with forking lightning, signifying the speed and power of thought. The Adytum, the primary temple of Vecna and the cult's main headquarters, is led by the First Thought of Vecna . While all other Thoughts are of equal rank, the First Thought stands above them. The current First Thought of Vecna is Ugwaerel Malcinex . Cult Ranks and Stat Blocks ex: In many cases, Memories and Thoughts might be less powerful than Teeth, but their greater devotion gives them a higher rank within the religious hierarchy. As Vecna's power is regained, his followers also become more powerful. Over time, even those in lower ranks of the cult are represented by creatures with greater CRs, and they are granted additional special abilities. These new abilities are gained when the Manifestation of Vecna recovers the Eye and Hand of Vecna (at the end of Vecna Lives), and then again when the ritual is carried out to draw in the powers of Vecna from the Outer Planes so he can be reborn (at the end of Vecna Reborn), but when he is drawn into the Demiplane of Dread his remaining followers on the Prime Material Plane lose some other abilities as well. This will be addressed in each book.

The Mound The interior stonework is still largely intact, but becomes more cracked and worn deeper into the mound. Passages are clear of roots. In the fourth paragraph, the result of a collapse should instead read: \"The stone in a five foot area gives way, cascading rock and dirt into the tomb. Each creature under the collapsing roof must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fortunately, the tree roots keep such collapses from becoming worse. A collapse will not block a passage, but the area becomes difficult terrain.\" In the fifth paragraph, possibly describe that the wards on the tomb feel empowering, but the mechanical effects are negligible. The bonus to player saving throws and penalty to enemy attacks are ignored. Describing the feeling of the empowering wards is worthwhile in order to make note of the sense of losing them in the final chamber. Limitations on spells to escape are unchanged. The Occupant of the Mound Additionally, the seals and enchantments on Halmadar's prison were so potent that the pervasive evil of the Hand and Eye of Vecna weren't able to dissipate, instead building up and concentrating within the inner chamber of the mound. As Halmadar raged and starved in his prison, the evil of the artifacts manifested his emotions as sorrowsworn. Investigating the Mound As soon as the Circle of Eight arrive at the mound, Halmadar is warned of them by a premonition from the powers of the Eye and the Hand. He then expends 2 charges from the Eye to cast clairvoyance and places the sensor near the party. Everything else is the same except for anything to do with ESP. Remove the final paragraph entirely. 1. Entrance Unchanged. 2. The Outer Seal Treat mold as Yellow Mold from DMG. 3. The Vaulted Chamber This octagonal chamber arches up perhaps ten feet. The opposite wall has an archway leading into an unlit passage. In each of the other six walls is an alcove where a large humanoid statue stands. On a slightly raised dais in the center of the room is an unadorned stone sarcophagus. The impressive stonework is obviously aged and starting to crack, seeming worse for wear closer to the far entrance. The corruption of Halmadar and the artifacts are responsible for the accelerated decay deeper into the cairn. The statues nearer to the far archway are mostly broken. The sarcophagus in the center is unadorned and empty aside from some stone dust. It was intended for Halmadar's consort, but was never used due to the circumstances of his internment. Once all eight wizards are in the room and have spent some time looking around, but before any of them try to leave out the other door, 4-6 of the statues animate as stone golems and attack the members of the Circle. 4. Magical Trap Removed. 5. Pit Attempting to climb around the pit requires a DC 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, part of the pit edge, wall, and ceiling collapse and send the character into the pit. The fall and rubble deal 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage. Hiding in the murky water at the bottom of the pit are three Wretched . 6. The Inner Seal A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check will identify the inscriptions as being abjurative in nature, made easier (DC 10) if the outer seal was also examined, casting detect magic also reveals this. A DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows the deduction that the ward is intended to keep something in, not out. In one side of the inscribed slab, there is a small crack. Spotting this requires a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Through this, the decay that has worn the rest of the cairn has leaked. This seal cannot be opened, broken, or otherwise manipulated until the wards are removed, which requires casting dispel magic with a DC 19, as if a 9th level spell. 7. Halmadar's Prison Replace the last two sentences of the boxed text with: A large stone platform fills one end of the chamber; atop it is an elaborately carved throne. The wood has begun to rot away, and a husk-like corpse is sits upon it with broken, rusted chains scattered around it, and a massive greatsword leaning against its side. On the floor before the platform is a large, intricate ouroboros, painted in what could only be blood. With the exception of the first paragraph, replace the entire rest of the section with the following: The body on the throne is none other than Halmadar the Cruel , if his clairvoyance spell is still active he is motionless while still focusing on it for a moment longer, but not long enough to make a difference in the following events. Hiding among the piles along the walls are the sorrowsworn manifestations of the warlord's rage at his internment and the starvation that lead to his death: 3 Hungry and 4 Angry . These sorrowsworn count as Halmadar's allies. The wizards have little time to orient themselves in the chamber. Not being one for subtlety, Halmadar engages the members of the Circle almost as soon as they enter his prison chamber. Prepared by the premonitions of the Eye and the Hand, and possibly the sensor of his clairvoyance , he is ready for them. Halmadar has advantage on his initiative roll, and all other creatures in the room are surprised for the first round of the encounter. Halmadar is boastful, claiming victory as soon as combat begins. He taunts the Circle for falling into his trap and freeing him. He thinks that he is Vecna, introducing himself with many of the archlich's titles as he rises from the throne and hefts his sword, but when he speaks the name \"Vecna\" it is instead heard only as a faint, incomprehensible whisper. After the first round where the wizards and the sorrowsworn are surprised, combat proceeds as normal. It is required that the Circle of Eight fall here. This fight should be impossible, and it should feel impossible, but it shouldn't feel cheap. As much as possible the players should feel like they were fairly beaten by an unbelievably powerful foe, and not like they were cheated (such as by instant kills while time is frozen). If required, have more sorrowsworn emerge from the detritus, thematically they should be Angry since Halmadar spent much longer being angry than hungry, but some Hungry can be included for variety. For the purposes of this encounter, Halmadar cannot be reduced below 1 hit point. Make note of how each member of the circle dies, it will be important later on.","title":"A Prologue"},{"location":"vl/0-a-prologue/#a-prologue-wherein-the-circle-of-eight-begins-a-membership-drive","text":"Revision note: Wherever it becomes relevant, note that Halmadar is/was Oeridian.

The wood has begun to rot away, and a husk-like corpse is sits upon it with broken, rusted chains scattered around it, and a massive greatsword leaning against its side. On the floor before the platform is a large, intricate ouroboros, painted in what could only be blood. With the exception of the first paragraph, replace the entire rest of the section with the following: The body on the throne is none other than Halmadar the Cruel , if his clairvoyance spell is still active he is motionless while still focusing on it for a moment longer, but not long enough to make a difference in the following events. Hiding among the piles along the walls are the sorrowsworn manifestations of the warlord's rage at his internment and the starvation that lead to his death: 3 Hungry and 4 Angry . These sorrowsworn count as Halmadar's allies. The wizards have little time to orient themselves in the chamber. Not being one for subtlety, Halmadar engages the members of the Circle almost as soon as they enter his prison chamber. Prepared by the premonitions of the Eye and the Hand, and possibly the sensor of his clairvoyance , he is ready for them. Halmadar has advantage on his initiative roll, and all other creatures in the room are surprised for the first round of the encounter. Halmadar is boastful, claiming victory as soon as combat begins. He taunts the Circle for falling into his trap and freeing him. He thinks that he is Vecna, introducing himself with many of the archlich's titles as he rises from the throne and hefts his sword, but when he speaks the name \"Vecna\" it is instead heard only as a faint, incomprehensible whisper. After the first round where the wizards and the sorrowsworn are surprised, combat proceeds as normal. It is required that the Circle of Eight fall here. This fight should be impossible, and it should feel impossible, but it shouldn't feel cheap. As much as possible the players should feel like they were fairly beaten by an unbelievably powerful foe, and not like they were cheated (such as by instant kills while time is frozen). If required, have more sorrowsworn emerge from the detritus, thematically they should be Angry since Halmadar spent much longer being angry than hungry, but some Hungry can be included for variety. For the purposes of this encounter, Halmadar cannot be reduced below 1 hit point. Make note of how each member of the circle dies, it will be important later on.","title":"7.

The Books In order to gain information from any of the books a character must be able to read the language the book is written in, either by knowing the language or a related dialect, or using an ability such as the warlock's Eyes of the Runekeeper . If the character knows only a related dialect, any scanning checks are made at disadvantage and fully reading the book takes the maximum possible time. If a character relies on comprehend languages to read or scan a book, the time to do so is doubled.

Depending on which member of the Circle they were connected to, members of the party may know of some or all of these. Otherwise, they might find directions through other means. Jallarzi Sallavarian Jallarzi's mansion is in the city's High Quarter, at H16. It is described on GoF61. Jallarzi sent her servants on vacation before she left with the rest of the Circle of Eight. Her vast but unfurnished house is uninhabited except for Edwina, her pseudodragon familiar she left behind because of her not getting along with Otiluke. Edwina Edwina is Jallarzi's familiar, a wild pseudodragon that the wizard befriended some time ago. This means she cannot be dismissed or summoned using the find familiar spell. Edwina has the stats of a pseudodragon (familiar variant) . When found, she will be immediately friendly with any member of the party who is not Otiluke's contact, but she will become especially attached to one of them, in the following order of preference: The character who is Jallarzi's contact Any elf or halfling that is not Otiluke's contact Any other character that is not Otiluke's contact The character who is Otiluke's contact Kindness from Otiluke's contact will eventually earn Edwina's favour, and she will not stay friendly with any member of the party who is unkind to her. If the character she initially attached to is cruel or unkind to her, she will abandon the party. With some effort, the character that Edwina became attached to can earn her trust and gain her as a familiar. Until this happens, that character does not get the benefits of her familiar trait. The mansion is largely unfurnished aside from the parlour, master suite, and a few guest suites. The master suite and two of the guest suites show evidence of having been lately occupied and not cleaned since. What Edwina knows Jallarzi was very concerned with whatever she and the other wizards were investigating, but glad for the chance to prove herself Tenser and Rary both stayed with Jallarzi in the house She accompanied Jallarzi on trips to Grey College and the Guild library, as well as meetings with the other Circle members in the house, at the Guild, and elsewhere Otto Otto's cottage is in the city's Garden Quarter, at G2. It is described on GoF63. What the groundkeepers know Otto was staying for several weeks and seemed much more frantic than usual He left a couple weeks ago and hasn't been seen since, which isn't unusual for him He was meeting up with various other wizard-types, but particularly closely with a short, small-looking one (Otiluke) came by often Otiluke Otiluke's house is in the city's River Quarter, at R15. It is described on GoF83. The house is inhabited by a handful of servants and a young woman named Glorial. Glorial (CG human apprentice wizard , she/her) is roughly half Otiluke's age (early 20s), and has been living with the older mage for nearly one and a half years now as his apprentice and, more recently, concubine. (Otiluke is a creep.) What Glorial knows Otiluke was frantically investigating something with a group of other wizards she didn't recognize. He was spending a lot of time with a curly-haired fat one (Otto) at Grey College. They also visited several temples in the city. She's not sure which but assumes the House of Boccob to be a good place to start. Street The River Quarter The Rhennee The priests of Trithereon or Olidammara know Yagos Slevak specifically The clannishness of the Rhennee makes questioning them difficult Asking about Almarth the Halt or Yagos Slevak will get back to them, and they will be smuggled out of the city Best way to get info is through an introduction, like through one of the temples. Xerbo is a good one for this Questions about the cult to non-cultists are met by fear and apprehension No matter how they approach questioning the Rhennee, they are eventually approached by Turim Varostak What the Rhennee Know Call the Cult of Vecna \"The Cult of the Seeing Hand\" Know the cult to be an evil group that has been gaining traction among their clan (though won't name names, and don't know any in specific) Know of the Eye and the Hand , and tell their children of them to scare them, but believe them to be real ~~Recommend going to Dyvers or Verbobonc for more information, cult is more active there~~ Remember wizards nosing around the waterfront some weeks ago Turim Varostak Turim Varostak is Vecna's manifestation on Oerth. He appears to be a tall, wiry, grizzled human sailor with thinning white hair and a permanent scowl. He is an honorary Rhennee, a fact indicated by a charm he wears dangling from his belt. His entire left side is badly scarred and mutilated. He has a peg in place of his left leg, a leather cuff ending with a hook over his left forearm, and a patch over his left eye. Claims to be a bargemaster Has various different stories as to his injuries. \"A sahuagin attack down by Saltmarsh\" etc. Acts as if wanting to help, actually wants the party's help in tracking down Halmadar and regaining his place as the Voice Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar After answering basics, he will disappear for a night and extract all information that Yagos knows, Yagos is found dead the next morning Will only give Yagos' intel if party lets him come along on the journey (to avenge the honour of the clan that took him in) and offers his boat and crew Ingratiated himself with the clan by risking his life in attempt to rescue Avrel's brother, although he failed (or so he says, actually a memory implanted by the powers of Vecna). Hence his injuries Yagos Slevak Yagos Slevak is the leader of the Fingers of Vecna among the Rhennee and in the region. He is a weaselly, oily sycophant of a man who may seem helpless but is actually quite dangerous. Rightfully mistrusted by most other Rhennee, but clannishness will still protect him unless outed as cultist Will not reveal status as cultist of Vecna Acts cooperative, hoping to lead the party into a trap far from the city Knows information in \"What the Rhennee Know\" sidebar Claims to have stumbled across a group of cultists in Verbobonc a few months ago and is being blackmailed by them Pretends to be afraid of the cult and requires significant payment in advance for his services Knows the location of the temple in Verbobonc and the rumors of Vecna's return Knows of the importance of Osnabr\u00f6lt but doesn't know what's there Hopes to stay alive by being useful, will keep information to himself but offers to take party there in person If his status as a cultist is made public, the Rhennee will turn on him. If they want his continued assistance, the party must negotiate for his life. This will only be allowed if the Rhennee can keep him under guard, requiring the party to travel with them. Almarth the Halt The players might recognize him from the attack at the Roc and Oliphant. If exposed, meets the same end as Yagos Knows as much as Yagos Cannot be forced to talk Won't go down without a fight Smuggled the Eye and the Hand into the city, as well as other cultists Will accidentally out Yagos as a co-conspirator if convinced that he was betrayed Might not out Yagos as a cultist specifically, may only indicate he was the captain of the ship he served on when smuggling cult members into Greyhawk Avrel Riskar Avrel Riskar is a Rhennee noble and a senior member of one of the clans currently in Greyhawk.

If they have ensured the Avrel they will track the cult to help regain his clan's reputation, or followed the information from Almarth that this is where he brought the cultists to Greyhawk from, this should be clear to them. But if they are fixated on the vague news they have from Osnabr\u00f6lt or on the fate of the Circle of Eight, are confused, or are too focused on some other direction, they can be nudged in the right direction if required. If Turim is with the party and has either been told or somehow else found out that the party is seeking the Cult of Vecna, he immediately and very conspicuously begins asking around about the cult. It is in his best interest to do so, since even alerting the cult will help him find them and claim his rightful position as the Voice of Vecna . This very quickly ensures that not only the cult, but other power groups in the city are aware of the party and their search. If the party travelled with Yagos ~~and are aware of his status as a cultist~~, he tells them that he will arrange a meeting with a contact of his within the cult that can get them to the temple in the city. The contact in question is Oaklin . If allowed to meet privately, they make plans for Yagos to take the party to the Rock Powder Inn where they will rendezvous with Oaklin, who will then lead them to an ambush at the quarry at night, under the pretense of it being a cult ceremony and the party arriving as new inductees. If the two aren't allowed to converse in private, Yagos will meet Oaklin with any party members who wish to be present, and introduce them to Oaklin as potential new disciples. Yagos will attempt to secretly convey to Oaklin that they are actually enemies of the cult and need to be dealt with, his deception can be seen through by making a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by Yagos' Charisma (Deception) check. Characters who do not know thieves' cant make the check at disadvantage, and may be unable determine the actual meaning of the coded exchange. If the secret message is able to go by unnoticed and uninterrupted, Oaklin sets up the same plan as if the two of them were able to meet alone. revision note: Yagos will play this slightly differently if he is known to be a cultist, or if he is acting as if he only knows about the cult and is acting out of fear of them. If the party arrived with the Rhennee fleet and Yagos has not been outed, he secretly informed the Cult of the party and their investigation. This makes its way up the cult structure in Verbobonc, then the Thought of the Organ dispatches one of their top operatives to tail them: the leader of the Fingers in Verbobonc, Oaklin the Half-Elf . News from Kieren Whenever the party determines that they are in a safe location to do so, they can contact Kieren with a sending as indicated they should do when they were in transit. When they do so, if the sending stone was used, they might be surprised that the response comes in Mordenkainen's voice: Have to trust your determination of security, we cannot scry you. Wait. We will be making contact shortly, this is a complex ritual. If Kieren is specifically targeted with a sending spell, she conveys something similar in her own manner. Alternate Approach (for my game, will probably cut from final) Option: Instead, Mordenkainen's response is I have arranged a meeting with the Bishop, he will be providing aid. Go to the Cathedral of St. Cuthbert, tell them Mordenkainen sent you. When they do so, the characters are brought in by the priests (who were given descriptions of the party) to the Bishop's private garden. On a table is an assortment of finger foods. A few moments later the Bishop and Alimora come in. Once basic introductions are complete, the Bishop puts on a ring similar to the one that Kieren wore in Chapter 2, signaling to Mordenkainen that they are gathered, and the scene proceeds as below. Projected images of Mordenkainen and Kieren appear to the characters, meanwhile the two of them and Ravel Dasinder are in the peak of the pyramid that contains the Greyhawk University of Magical Arts. Details: The divination blackout isn't just spreading, it's becoming more intense in places More and more divinations are starting to fail (lower and lower level spells) Contact to the gods is becoming difficult (higher level cleric and paladin powers are failing) insert other things here depending on how much time has passed and following progression from An Interlude earlier Just this sort of telepresence is exceedingly difficult, the ritual is requiring all three of them to channel it in order to work, from a magically amplifying location (the wizard school), and even then it's unknown how long it will last It is also spreading, blanketing more of the Flanaess List some countries affected Mordenkainen managed to track source of blackout to two sites One was deep within the borders of Iuz, and already thoroughly controlled by the Old One's forces How was Iuz ahead of them in finding it? By the source being within its borders, the Empire of Iuz must have noticed and subsequently tracked and found the source faster The other was in southern Keoland, where Mordenkainen found it (maybe in the Dreadwood?) Site was a ruined temple, serpent and eye-in-hand imagery were prevalent, indicates cult connection and longevity In the temple, found a stone tablet that seems to be the specific source of the blackout Moving the tablet from the temple moved the blackout epicenter with it The tablet appears to describe some sort of ritual, it's imbued with extremely powerful magic, and is as old as it and the temple seem It's difficult to tell for sure, all divination magic fails too close to it, so spells like identify are useless Relying on mundane observation and research instead [Our campaign specific] This was confirmed by a second opinion from a contact of Nystul's in the church of Bleredd, who was also reached by the vision of the Circle falling Mordenkainen brought her to Verbobonc to meet them, she is waiting at the temple of Saint Cuthbert The Bishop insists on knowing about the cult investigation, he has invited the party to lunch (whenever that makes sense to be) For now, he has taken the tablet to his citadel in the Yatil Mountains for study, which has lessened the blackout over Greyhawk The City City slogan: \"Earth and Stone, Man and Gnome\" His Noble Lordship, the Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc (LG Oeridian human noble or veteran , he/him) Despite substantial mineral riches and significant trade power bringing much affluence to the Viscounty, not all of the region's residents are advantaged by this wealth, especially in the town of Verbobonc itself. Many were once caravaneers who lost their livelihoods to the vicious raids by the Horde of Elemental Evil in years past; others veterans of the Battle of Emridy Meadows some thirteen years past, who were left disabled and cast aside once the foe was routed; or adventurers left scarred and broken by the horrors of the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, which they delved into in effort to end the Horde's so-called \"Second Rising\" only a few years ago. They tend to settle near the town's docks, the most likely place for them to find shelter, work, or passage to better opportunity. Whatever the reason for their poverty, the arrogantly classist citizenry of Verbobonc try to overlook and ignore these destitute folk, leaving them to fend for themselves. Even the church of St. Cuthbert, so powerful in these lands, is more focused on stomping out evil than caring for the needy. As such, the poor and forgotten of Verbobonc have banded together, forging a strong comradery amongst themselves, working together and caring for each other's well-being. The epitome of this communal assistance is a man named Virianis Dast (NG Baklunish human commoner , he/him). Once a merchant and trader of significant respect, Virianis watched as his business died at the hands of the Horde's raids, eventually leaving him entirely bankrupt. He wasn't the first for this to happen to, and far from the last, but over time his cool head, humbleness, and kindness earned him no little respect as a mediator among the needy of Verbobonc, and a representative between them and the rest of the city. With his former connections among the Viscounty's merchant class and knack for logistics he also became something of a coordinator of how the community's resources are put to use. His position as a de facto leader of those living in poverty has earned him various titles, such as \"the Beggar King,\" or \"the Suffering Sultan.\" These were used derisively by the city at large but eventually accepted with some humor by Dast and his community. Even though he is later in his years, Virianis Dast spends much of his time moving about the city, mostly around the docks, checking on and catching up with the people of his community, asking after their concerns and making sure their needs are taken care of. Other times he can be found in a backroom of a particular warehouse down by the docks, the last remaining part of his old business that he has somehow managed to hold onto. The main space he shares with those who need it, offering them much-needed shelter, and in the back he makes his own quarters, meets with anyone who wishes to speak to him, and plans with others how to best distribute the community's resources. Virianis is rarely far from his \"honor guard\", rotating pairs of local teens (any non-evil alignment, any race thugs , any pronouns) who have taken it upon themselves to assist and protect him at all times. He has never asked them to do this, but allows them to do so and appreciates them immensely, he is very fond of them all. Gnomeburg Miral Cutterfro (NG rock gnome commoner , she/her) Larossa ~~Baru~~ Tomenook (CG stout halfling commoner or bard , she/her) 4 Sons: Alston Gimble Kellen Sindri Vargannos Searching His Holiness, Bishop Haufren of Saint Cuthbert (LN Oeridian human war priest , he/him) Provost of the City, First Magistrate of Security, Her Prominence Rollei Augustin (LN Suloise human noble , she/her) The Right Honorable Sir Alfentrask (LG Oeridian half-orc knight , they/them) Gentlefolk of the Watch (LN/LG/N/NG various guards ) The first morning the party wakes in Verbobonc once the cult knows of their presence, they find a finger hanging on their door. Make it the finger of someone they like for extra effect. The cult has been putting a trap in motion since becoming aware of the party's presence. Bishop is concerned about the loss of divine powers and cult activity Instead of directing them towards the taverns like in the book text, Bishop Haufren suggests the party seek out Virianis Dast. He doesn't explicitly say it, but he suspects that the cult is predominately active among the poor. Y: So? Is it true? The Whispered One has returned? O: Yes! We found him out in the hills some days ago, just as prophesized. Y: And? O: And what? Lord ||Vecna|| walks on Oerth again, in all of his terror and glory. He is cruel and fierce. The Serpent whispers to him, and his genius is beyond our comprehension. Y: Incredible. When will I see him? O: Soon, my friend. Soon. The Heart is on her way now, and when she arrives they will carry out the ritual so he may regain his full power. When the time comes, you will be summoned. Y: The Heart is coming to Verbobonc? These are truly benighted times. [Pleased] O: And we will be made greater by them. But now we should go, lie low until the time comes. Y: And the other thing we spoke of? O: I'll make sure it's dealt with. The \"Castle\" TODO Return to Halmadar's Tomb The party may be eager to set out to the Kron Hills in search of Halmadar's Tomb, even if they don't know that this was where the Circle of Eight fell, their research all but certainly points to it as the next step on the archmages' trail. If they attempt to do so, the burial mound is not easy to find. When the Circle of Eight searched for it, the divination blackout was still weak enough in this region that they were able to rely on magic to locate it, a luxury no longer available to the player characters. Instead, they might locate the tomb by other means, such as: Finding and getting the help of the same guide that the Circle of Eight hired to take them into the hills. He might not know exactly where the mound is but might be able to lead the party to where he and the wizards parted ways. Simply setting out into the hills and following Halmadar's trail of destruction back to its source. Being lead there by the gnomes of Osnabr\u00f6lt, Halmadar's entombment was only 130-some years ago, many of the gnomes there were alive at the time and even participated in its construction. This option is best saved for if the party only think to seek out the tomb after they have gone to Osnabr\u00f6lt in the later chapter. Or another approach at the DM's discretion. See Book 2, Chapter 2 for more information on venturing into the Kron Hills. Arriving at the tomb, the party finds the aftermath of the Circle of Eight's investigation of it. Roughly a month has passed since then. Little has changed since the prologue , except as described below: The stonework is substantially more cracked, and the ceilings are crumbling in places. If the Circle cleared the roots from the entranceway, they are still cleared but are beginning to grow back. The outer seal is open, even if the Circle did not leave it open. The aftermath of the battle and investigation in the Vaulted Chamber is evident. The spaces where the defeated statues fell are now difficult terrain. If any of the 6 statues did not animate to attack the Circle of Eight, those remaining do now and attack the party. Instead of stone golems the remaining statues might be reduced-threat stone golems (half the normal hit point maximum and takes a \u22122 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs). The wretched living in the bottom of the pit are still there if the Circle did not destroy them. The inner seal is destroyed, even if the Circle found a way through without destroying it. In Halmadar's Prison they find the rotting corpses of the Circle of Eight, not necessarily in the exact places they fell. The ones that had their bones turned to jelly by the Hand of Vecna are very difficult to identify. The very old ouroboros painted in blood on the floor has been completed with the eye-in-hand symbol of Vecna in much fresher blood. After recovering Halmadar out in the hills, the cultists of Vecna returned here to do this and to loot the bodies. The wizards' most powerful magic items were all stolen, but it is possible that some of the more minor items went unnoticed or ignored. While exploring the room, the party might find that they are not alone. Some ideas for what might be in there with them are: There are still one or more sorrowsworn hidden in the refuse around the room, such as the lonely . A young deep dragon recently burrowed up into the tomb from below now that the wards have failed, intending to make its lair there, and claim the Circle's remaining items as the beginning of its hoard. It has either hidden itself in the detritus around the chamber or is down in the tunnels below when the party first enter. The adventurers might think to defeat it to claim its hoard, but if they instead parley with it they could gain themselves a useful ally and an opportunity to barter for some of the contents in the hoard The Cult Acts Once Oaklin has set the party on the path towards the quarry, if he is not accompanying them, after he reports in to the cult leadership, he sends his quasit familiar to stalk them invisibly. The Rock Powder Inn Like 6 hours out from Verbobonc on foot? (I dunno, ran it something like that.) -> Because of the rain. Going back the next day with no rain takes closer to 5. Grammo Saxinus (N half-elf commoner , he/him) Ansrith Saxinus (N wood elf commoner , she/they) Cylene Saxinus (NG half-elf commoner , she/her) All three know Elvish, and have Darkvision and Fey Ancestry features. Ansrith also has the Trance feature. Young Farmer (speaking somewhat breathlessly): \"...along the old Wirthin trail, I found some blood. Big trail of it went off into the wood, it did, toward the pit.\" (Gulps down more wine.) Old Man: \"Eh, how do you know? That trail's nowhere near the old pit!\" Young Farmer. \"I followed it. I had a good sword with me, an' figured I might find what's been making the trouble. With the rain, there's no telling how long that trail'd last\u2014but when I got up on the ridge, I could see lights down there, moving around. An' I heard screams! That was enough for me, I tell you! I lit out straight for here!\" Cylene (Standing beside them): \"Oh, Dennis O'Berrin, you're a daring fool! What if something had got you there?\" (The young farmer blushes.) Old Man: \"Tomorrow we'll get ourselves up there, and we'll see if your words are true.\" Young Farmer. \"What about the militia? I could be to the city by tomorrow....\" Old Man: \"Nae, the nobles won't be interested in the likes of you. This is a local problem. We don't need no outsiders.\" Ambush at the Quarry Like another hour-ish from the inn, with the rain? Instead of imp(s), a quasit named Zarenival (Oaklin's familiar) No Thought at ambush (too high ranked to be there), one or more Memories instead Nothics instead of Vampiric Mists Disciples of the Verbobonc cell of the Cult of Vecna who fail to embrace the cult's higher mysteries and are transformed into the \"Spawn of Vecna\" ( nothics ) are smuggled out of town and released into the quarry. They are responsible for the strange noises at night and death of livestock that the locals have reported. TODO: Grab encounter from DDB and Discord and write up here. Remember that Nothic HP was cut down to 30 in play because of worry that it would be too hard. Not sure if that was really necessary? Also gave Enchanter mind sliver instead of mending . Quarry Chase Complications d20 Complication 1 Uneven ground or loose stone threatens to slow your progress. Make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to navigate the area. On a failed check, the ground counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain. 2 A flash of lightning illuminates the area. Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are blinded until the end of your turn. While blinded in this way, your speed is halved. On a successful save, if you are a pursuer, you make your next Wisdom (Perception) check at advantage. 3 A crash of thunder echoes through the quarry. Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are deafened until the end of your turn. 4 A sudden drop catches you by surprise. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On a failed save, you fall 1d4 \u00d7 5 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen as normal, and land prone. 5 The ground beneath your feet is slippery with rainwater, mud, or wet gravel. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you fall prone. 6 There is a boulder in your way. Make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (your choice) to vault over or avoid it. On a failed check, you collide with the boulder and take 1d4 bludgeoning damage. 7 A gust of wind buffets you. Make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you must use an additional 10 feet of movement to get through the wind. 8 Wind whips at you from behind. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you fall prone. On a successful save, you may take 10 feet of movement for free. 9 A bolt of lightning lashes down from the clouds above. If you are 20 or more feet above the floor of the quarry, make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. 10 An orb of ball lightning races towards you. If you are on the ground, make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. 11-20 No complication. Caught Off Guard Just the nothics? Maybe show up as the cultists are dumping another nothic? Aftermath Victory Defeat Level Advancement The characters advance from 6th to 7th level after the events at the quarry, or if they discover the location of the cult while avoiding it entirely. Beryn Talkin advances in level, becoming a 6th-level spellcaster. This gives him an additional 3rd level spell slot (for a total of three) and he gains the spell vampiric touch . Additionally, he gains the Inescapable Destruction feature, allowing necrotic damage dealt by his cleric spells and Divine Eminence to ignore resistance to necrotic damage.","title":"Ch. 5: Verbobonc"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#chapter-5-verbobonc","text":"TODO: This entire chapter needs cleanup and fleshing out Upon arriving in Verbobonc, the party's priority should be locating the cultists there.

Details: The divination blackout isn't just spreading, it's becoming more intense in places More and more divinations are starting to fail (lower and lower level spells) Contact to the gods is becoming difficult (higher level cleric and paladin powers are failing) insert other things here depending on how much time has passed and following progression from An Interlude earlier Just this sort of telepresence is exceedingly difficult, the ritual is requiring all three of them to channel it in order to work, from a magically amplifying location (the wizard school), and even then it's unknown how long it will last It is also spreading, blanketing more of the Flanaess List some countries affected Mordenkainen managed to track source of blackout to two sites One was deep within the borders of Iuz, and already thoroughly controlled by the Old One's forces How was Iuz ahead of them in finding it? By the source being within its borders, the Empire of Iuz must have noticed and subsequently tracked and found the source faster The other was in southern Keoland, where Mordenkainen found it (maybe in the Dreadwood?) Site was a ruined temple, serpent and eye-in-hand imagery were prevalent, indicates cult connection and longevity In the temple, found a stone tablet that seems to be the specific source of the blackout Moving the tablet from the temple moved the blackout epicenter with it The tablet appears to describe some sort of ritual, it's imbued with extremely powerful magic, and is as old as it and the temple seem It's difficult to tell for sure, all divination magic fails too close to it, so spells like identify are useless Relying on mundane observation and research instead [Our campaign specific] This was confirmed by a second opinion from a contact of Nystul's in the church of Bleredd, who was also reached by the vision of the Circle falling Mordenkainen brought her to Verbobonc to meet them, she is waiting at the temple of Saint Cuthbert The Bishop insists on knowing about the cult investigation, he has invited the party to lunch (whenever that makes sense to be) For now, he has taken the tablet to his citadel in the Yatil Mountains for study, which has lessened the blackout over Greyhawk","title":"News from Kieren"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#the-city","text":"City slogan: \"Earth and Stone, Man and Gnome\" His Noble Lordship, the Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc (LG Oeridian human noble or veteran , he/him) Despite substantial mineral riches and significant trade power bringing much affluence to the Viscounty, not all of the region's residents are advantaged by this wealth, especially in the town of Verbobonc itself. Many were once caravaneers who lost their livelihoods to the vicious raids by the Horde of Elemental Evil in years past; others veterans of the Battle of Emridy Meadows some thirteen years past, who were left disabled and cast aside once the foe was routed; or adventurers left scarred and broken by the horrors of the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, which they delved into in effort to end the Horde's so-called \"Second Rising\" only a few years ago. They tend to settle near the town's docks, the most likely place for them to find shelter, work, or passage to better opportunity. Whatever the reason for their poverty, the arrogantly classist citizenry of Verbobonc try to overlook and ignore these destitute folk, leaving them to fend for themselves. Even the church of St. Cuthbert, so powerful in these lands, is more focused on stomping out evil than caring for the needy. As such, the poor and forgotten of Verbobonc have banded together, forging a strong comradery amongst themselves, working together and caring for each other's well-being. The epitome of this communal assistance is a man named Virianis Dast (NG Baklunish human commoner , he/him). Once a merchant and trader of significant respect, Virianis watched as his business died at the hands of the Horde's raids, eventually leaving him entirely bankrupt. He wasn't the first for this to happen to, and far from the last, but over time his cool head, humbleness, and kindness earned him no little respect as a mediator among the needy of Verbobonc, and a representative between them and the rest of the city. With his former connections among the Viscounty's merchant class and knack for logistics he also became something of a coordinator of how the community's resources are put to use. His position as a de facto leader of those living in poverty has earned him various titles, such as \"the Beggar King,\" or \"the Suffering Sultan.\" These were used derisively by the city at large but eventually accepted with some humor by Dast and his community. Even though he is later in his years, Virianis Dast spends much of his time moving about the city, mostly around the docks, checking on and catching up with the people of his community, asking after their concerns and making sure their needs are taken care of. Other times he can be found in a backroom of a particular warehouse down by the docks, the last remaining part of his old business that he has somehow managed to hold onto. The main space he shares with those who need it, offering them much-needed shelter, and in the back he makes his own quarters, meets with anyone who wishes to speak to him, and plans with others how to best distribute the community's resources. Virianis is rarely far from his \"honor guard\", rotating pairs of local teens (any non-evil alignment, any race thugs , any pronouns) who have taken it upon themselves to assist and protect him at all times. He has never asked them to do this, but allows them to do so and appreciates them immensely, he is very fond of them all.","title":"The City"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#gnomeburg","text":"Miral Cutterfro (NG rock gnome commoner , she/her) Larossa ~~Baru~~ Tomenook (CG stout halfling commoner or bard , she/her) 4 Sons: Alston Gimble Kellen Sindri Vargannos","title":"Gnomeburg"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#searching","text":"His Holiness, Bishop Haufren of Saint Cuthbert (LN Oeridian human war priest , he/him) Provost of the City, First Magistrate of Security, Her Prominence Rollei Augustin (LN Suloise human noble , she/her) The Right Honorable Sir Alfentrask (LG Oeridian half-orc knight , they/them) Gentlefolk of the Watch (LN/LG/N/NG various guards ) The first morning the party wakes in Verbobonc once the cult knows of their presence, they find a finger hanging on their door.

If they attempt to do so, the burial mound is not easy to find. When the Circle of Eight searched for it, the divination blackout was still weak enough in this region that they were able to rely on magic to locate it, a luxury no longer available to the player characters. Instead, they might locate the tomb by other means, such as: Finding and getting the help of the same guide that the Circle of Eight hired to take them into the hills. He might not know exactly where the mound is but might be able to lead the party to where he and the wizards parted ways. Simply setting out into the hills and following Halmadar's trail of destruction back to its source. Being lead there by the gnomes of Osnabr\u00f6lt, Halmadar's entombment was only 130-some years ago, many of the gnomes there were alive at the time and even participated in its construction. This option is best saved for if the party only think to seek out the tomb after they have gone to Osnabr\u00f6lt in the later chapter. Or another approach at the DM's discretion. See Book 2, Chapter 2 for more information on venturing into the Kron Hills. Arriving at the tomb, the party finds the aftermath of the Circle of Eight's investigation of it. Roughly a month has passed since then. Little has changed since the prologue , except as described below: The stonework is substantially more cracked, and the ceilings are crumbling in places. If the Circle cleared the roots from the entranceway, they are still cleared but are beginning to grow back. The outer seal is open, even if the Circle did not leave it open. The aftermath of the battle and investigation in the Vaulted Chamber is evident. The spaces where the defeated statues fell are now difficult terrain. If any of the 6 statues did not animate to attack the Circle of Eight, those remaining do now and attack the party. Instead of stone golems the remaining statues might be reduced-threat stone golems (half the normal hit point maximum and takes a \u22122 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs). The wretched living in the bottom of the pit are still there if the Circle did not destroy them. The inner seal is destroyed, even if the Circle found a way through without destroying it. In Halmadar's Prison they find the rotting corpses of the Circle of Eight, not necessarily in the exact places they fell. The ones that had their bones turned to jelly by the Hand of Vecna are very difficult to identify. The very old ouroboros painted in blood on the floor has been completed with the eye-in-hand symbol of Vecna in much fresher blood. After recovering Halmadar out in the hills, the cultists of Vecna returned here to do this and to loot the bodies. The wizards' most powerful magic items were all stolen, but it is possible that some of the more minor items went unnoticed or ignored. While exploring the room, the party might find that they are not alone. Some ideas for what might be in there with them are: There are still one or more sorrowsworn hidden in the refuse around the room, such as the lonely . A young deep dragon recently burrowed up into the tomb from below now that the wards have failed, intending to make its lair there, and claim the Circle's remaining items as the beginning of its hoard. It has either hidden itself in the detritus around the chamber or is down in the tunnels below when the party first enter. The adventurers might think to defeat it to claim its hoard, but if they instead parley with it they could gain themselves a useful ally and an opportunity to barter for some of the contents in the hoard","title":"The \"Castle\""},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#the-cult-acts","text":"Once Oaklin has set the party on the path towards the quarry, if he is not accompanying them, after he reports in to the cult leadership, he sends his quasit familiar to stalk them invisibly.","title":"The Cult Acts"},{"location":"vl/5-verbobonc/#the-rock-powder-inn","text":"Like 6 hours out from Verbobonc on foot?

[LGG132] The fertile upper reaches of the Kron Hills are home to some twenty thousand gnomes and scattered human farmers and herders. Once claimed by Verbobonc, the northern hills are now a realm unto itself, the so-called Free Assembly of the Kron Hills, ruled by the wise Urthgan the Eldest of Tulvar. The gnomes get on well with all local nonhumans; many gnomes are veterans of the Hateful Wars decades ago, and all are proud of their military traditions. Mineral wealth is plentiful throughout. [LGG145-146] It is estimated that nearly 20,000 gnomes live within the region of the Kron Hills. These heights spring eastward from the Lortmils and reach almost to Nyr Dyv. Their verge forms the southern boundary of Veluna, then stretches beside the Velverdyva for a time before peaking in the heart of the Gnarley Forest, where many Sylvan Elves happily roam over their crests. Their southern slopes demark the end of the Wild Coast region and are a part of the northern region of Celene. Some dwarven enclaves exist in the Kron Hills where they butt against the Lortmils, although the number of such demi-humans is not known. The gnomes of the region were instrumental in the organization of the army which drove the humanoid hordes from the Lortmils (and the Kron Hills). They likewise served with honor in the host which defeated the Horde of Elemental Evil in the battle above Verbobonc. The Kron Hills are mined for metals, precious metals, and gems. The upper slopes are quite fertile and grow many crops in sheltered valley and glen. Quite a number of scattered enclaves of humans live in peace with the gnomes and other demi-humans of the area, save in the Gnarley Forest, where the Olvenfolk are isolationist. [WoG49] Rumors and Information Entries in italics are false. Iuz has sent his forces to the region to rebuild and reclaim the Temple of Elemental Evil A dragon has been seen crisscrossing the Hills of late, it probably has recently made its lair somewhere nearby Iuzite troops have been crawling all over the hills, conducting raids Whatever happened to Osnabr\u00f6lt, the Iuzites are responsible The tragedy that befell Osnabr\u00f6lt is only the latest in the warren's long and troubled history Kron Hills Encounters d20 Encounter 1-2 Elven Remnants 3-4 Feywild Crossings 5-8 Iuzite Activity 9-11 Hills Flora and Fauna 12-13 Gnomes 14-15 Other Inhabitants 16-17 Outsiders 18-19 Viscounty 20 Utreshimon Elven Remnants Long before humans came to Verbobonc, the surrounding land was claimed by the elves. The elves spread out into the hills, where they lived and treated with the gnomes of the area. While the elves retreated west into the Gnarley Forest and south into Celene when they chose to cede the land to the arriving humans, many remnants of those days still dot the Kron Hills. Roll a d8 and consult, or choose from, the Elven Remnant Sites table to determine what the characters encounter. Searching near the site of an elven remnant might turn up items from that bygone era, whether left there intentionally or lost in years past. Finding such hidden stashes requires a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Roll a d8 and consult, or choose from, the Ancient Elven Relics table to determine what the characters' searching uncovers. Elven Remnant Sites d8 Site 1 An old stone archway of obvious elven design. Any character who passes under it makes Wisdom (Perception) checks with advantage for 1 hour. 2 The stub of an old stone tower jutting from the top of a hill 3 A 15-foot-tall stone statue of an elf warrior that has been tipped over on its side 4 A waist-high, worn stone obelisk marked with elvish writing indicating directions to various settlements that no longer exist, or by ancient elven names that are no longer used 5 A circle of standing stones within which the air is utterly still, no matter how hard the wind blows outside 6 An elaborate, abstract statue tops one of the hills nearby 7 A 50-foot-tall stone statue of an elf warrior with hand raised, palm out, as if to forbid travelers from coming this way 8 An ancient burial ground with 2d6 elven grave markers Ancient Elven Relics d8 Relic 1 2d8 arrowheads engraved with intricate patterns 2 A single slender gauntlet for either the right (50%) or left (50%) hand 3 A long, slim, single-edged dagger with a slightly curved blade 4 1d4 ancient elven gold pieces 5 1d6 ancient elven electrum pieces 6 1d8 ancient elven silver pieces 7 1d10 ancient elven copper pieces 8 Choose or roll for one item from the Elven Trinkets table in Chapter 2 of Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes Typical merchants may look at the ancient coinage with some suspicion, but coin is still coin and spends just as well as modern currency. Optionally, a character may be required to make a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) to convince someone to accept the coins, or to make a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to use the coins without drawing question to their provenance. While these coins can still be spent according to their modern equivalences, they may hold even greater value to collectors. Feywild Crossings While potentially more common in the Gnarley Forest to the east, there are places in the Kron Hills where the border between the Material Plane and the the Feywild is thin, sometimes thin enough for creatures to pass through and roam the hills as they please. Other times this proximity to the Plane of Faerie creates locations suffused with the magic of the fey. Some scholars wonder if this connection to the Feywild was what drew the elves to the region in the distant past, or if the elves were instead responsible for the crossings themselves.

Between the abandoned village and the storied town of Hommlet stands an abandoned moathouse. This fortification was once integral to the defense of the region against the Temple's Hordes, but it too has now been abandoned. Seizing upon this opportunity, an adult blue dragon named Utreshimon has taken the keep as his new (perhaps second?) home. Utreshimon has only recently reached adulthood, and is still trying to establish his hold on the world. Utreshimon in Canon Utreshimon is a character introduced in the 3rd edition adventure Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil where he is a young blue dragon that had only made his home in the moathouse about a week before the events of the adventure. The choice here to make Utreshimon an older dragon, and to have him established in the region much earlier is to add a greater threat and additional player into the power dynamics of the Kron Hills. Personality Trait. I\u2019m so pleased with myself and my own good fortune that I can\u2019t stop laughing or chuckling. Ideal. Humor. Lesser beings exist to be my playthings, and I excel at finding ways to toy with them. Bond. I feel an obligation to protect the creatures that inhabit my territory (except the ones I eat). Flaw. Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep. Utreshimon tends not to target the intelligent inhabitants of the Kron Hills, knowing that if they and the powers of Verbobonc turn against him he could be driven out of his new home, or worse. At the same time, he is not too happy with the Iuzite activity all over what he considers his domain and has been venturing far out from his new lair to combat the roving troops, even spending days at a time without returning to the moathouse. Utreshimon Encounters d6 Encounter 1-3 Tracks and Traces 4-5 Overhead 6 In the Flesh Tracks and Traces d6 Traces 1 Prints. The dirt is marked by large footprints and the furrows of a dragged tail. If Utreshimon has not been seen before, a character who succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine the size of creature that would leave such prints, and a result of 15 or higher can determine that they were left by a dragon specifically. If he has been seen, the characters can easily assume that he left the prints. 2 Claw marks. Deep slashes mark a tree trunk, log, or stone surface. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine that the gouges were left by the claws of a massive creature. There is no certain way to tell what the creature is or was, but characters who have seen Utreshimon will likely make assumptions. 3 Leveled foliage. All plant life in a roughly 20 foot radius circle has either been crushed or blasted away. Plants nearer the center of the area are flattened, while ones farther out have been blown outwards, losing leaves, branches, or even being uprooted entirely. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine that this effect was caused by the takeoff of a massive, winged creature. Characters who have seen Utreshimon can tell that he is the right size to be responsible. 4 Droppings. Sizable droppings mark the hillside, either scattered or in a pile. Any creature who moves within 10 feet of the droppings must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for as long as it remains in the area. A creature who leaves the area must repeat the saving throw if it later reenters. Determining the size of creature that would leave such droppings requires a character to succeed on a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check, and a result of 18 or higher is required to draw the conclusion that it came from a dragon specifically. 5-6 Dead Iuz troops. A gruesome scene litters the area ahead, where the corpses of a group of Iuz's forces lie unmoving, killed by the dragon. Use the Iuzite Encounters table to determine the bodies that are found (on a 1, roll again and those are the bodies found in the camp). A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Medicine) check can discover the causes of death: The vast majority, if not all, were killed by what appears to be concentrated lightning (the dragon's breath weapon), while the rest were torn apart with tooth and claw. Overhead The characters notice the blue dragon flying overhead. The silhouette is unmistakable as that of a dragon, but a character must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to identify it as a blue dragon. Utreshimon notices the characters as well unless they are travelling through the Hills stealthily, in which case any character attempting to remain hidden must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the blue dragon's passive perception score. Utreshimon passes on overhead unless he notices the party travelling with the forces of Iuz, or openly flying Iuz's banner, in which case he swoops down and engages them in combat. If the roll on the Utreshimon Encounters table was a 5, the dragon is flying low enough to use his Frightful Presence ability on any creatures he can see. Even if he has no plans on engaging them, this is something he sometimes does for his own amusement to remind the creatures of the Hills of the pecking order. If the roll was a 4, he is too high up to use the ability. In the Flesh Utreshimon engages with the characters directly, but is not hostile unless they appear to be in league with Iuz. Most likely, he will wish to speak to the party simply out of interest, possibly after having noticed them a few times (perhaps while staying unnoticed himself) during their trek through the Kron Hills. As long as the characters can assure the dragon that they hold no loyalty to Iuz, he lets them go unharmed, and even offers his protection above that if they convince him that they are actively working against Iuz in this region. If the dragon is unconvinced of the party's loyalties, or if he is attacked by them, he does not hold back in fighting them but will retreat rather than fight to the death.

[LGG132] The fertile upper reaches of the Kron Hills are home to some twenty thousand gnomes and scattered human farmers and herders. Once claimed by Verbobonc, the northern hills are now a realm unto itself, the so-called Free Assembly of the Kron Hills, ruled by the wise Urthgan the Eldest of Tulvar. The gnomes get on well with all local nonhumans; many gnomes are veterans of the Hateful Wars decades ago, and all are proud of their military traditions. Mineral wealth is plentiful throughout. [LGG145-146] It is estimated that nearly 20,000 gnomes live within the region of the Kron Hills. These heights spring eastward from the Lortmils and reach almost to Nyr Dyv. Their verge forms the southern boundary of Veluna, then stretches beside the Velverdyva for a time before peaking in the heart of the Gnarley Forest, where many Sylvan Elves happily roam over their crests. Their southern slopes demark the end of the Wild Coast region and are a part of the northern region of Celene. Some dwarven enclaves exist in the Kron Hills where they butt against the Lortmils, although the number of such demi-humans is not known. The gnomes of the region were instrumental in the organization of the army which drove the humanoid hordes from the Lortmils (and the Kron Hills). They likewise served with honor in the host which defeated the Horde of Elemental Evil in the battle above Verbobonc. The Kron Hills are mined for metals, precious metals, and gems. The upper slopes are quite fertile and grow many crops in sheltered valley and glen. Quite a number of scattered enclaves of humans live in peace with the gnomes and other demi-humans of the area, save in the Gnarley Forest, where the Olvenfolk are isolationist.

Between the abandoned village and the storied town of Hommlet stands an abandoned moathouse. This fortification was once integral to the defense of the region against the Temple's Hordes, but it too has now been abandoned. Seizing upon this opportunity, an adult blue dragon named Utreshimon has taken the keep as his new (perhaps second?) home. Utreshimon has only recently reached adulthood, and is still trying to establish his hold on the world. Utreshimon in Canon Utreshimon is a character introduced in the 3rd edition adventure Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil where he is a young blue dragon that had only made his home in the moathouse about a week before the events of the adventure. The choice here to make Utreshimon an older dragon, and to have him established in the region much earlier is to add a greater threat and additional player into the power dynamics of the Kron Hills. Personality Trait. I\u2019m so pleased with myself and my own good fortune that I can\u2019t stop laughing or chuckling. Ideal. Humor. Lesser beings exist to be my playthings, and I excel at finding ways to toy with them. Bond. I feel an obligation to protect the creatures that inhabit my territory (except the ones I eat). Flaw. Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep. Utreshimon tends not to target the intelligent inhabitants of the Kron Hills, knowing that if they and the powers of Verbobonc turn against him he could be driven out of his new home, or worse. At the same time, he is not too happy with the Iuzite activity all over what he considers his domain and has been venturing far out from his new lair to combat the roving troops, even spending days at a time without returning to the moathouse.","title":"Utreshimon"},{"location":"vr/2-kron-hills/#utreshimon-encounters","text":"d6 Encounter 1-3 Tracks and Traces 4-5 Overhead 6 In the Flesh","title":"Utreshimon Encounters"},{"location":"vr/2-kron-hills/#tracks-and-traces","text":"d6 Traces 1 Prints. The dirt is marked by large footprints and the furrows of a dragged tail. If Utreshimon has not been seen before, a character who succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine the size of creature that would leave such prints, and a result of 15 or higher can determine that they were left by a dragon specifically. If he has been seen, the characters can easily assume that he left the prints. 2 Claw marks. Deep slashes mark a tree trunk, log, or stone surface. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine that the gouges were left by the claws of a massive creature. There is no certain way to tell what the creature is or was, but characters who have seen Utreshimon will likely make assumptions. 3 Leveled foliage. All plant life in a roughly 20 foot radius circle has either been crushed or blasted away. Plants nearer the center of the area are flattened, while ones farther out have been blown outwards, losing leaves, branches, or even being uprooted entirely. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine that this effect was caused by the takeoff of a massive, winged creature. Characters who have seen Utreshimon can tell that he is the right size to be responsible. 4 Droppings. Sizable droppings mark the hillside, either scattered or in a pile. Any creature who moves within 10 feet of the droppings must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for as long as it remains in the area. A creature who leaves the area must repeat the saving throw if it later reenters. Determining the size of creature that would leave such droppings requires a character to succeed on a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check, and a result of 18 or higher is required to draw the conclusion that it came from a dragon specifically. 5-6 Dead Iuz troops. A gruesome scene litters the area ahead, where the corpses of a group of Iuz's forces lie unmoving, killed by the dragon. Use the Iuzite Encounters table to determine the bodies that are found (on a 1, roll again and those are the bodies found in the camp). A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Medicine) check can discover the causes of death: The vast majority, if not all, were killed by what appears to be concentrated lightning (the dragon's breath weapon), while the rest were torn apart with tooth and claw.","title":"Tracks and Traces"},{"location":"vr/2-kron-hills/#overhead","text":"The characters notice the blue dragon flying overhead.

Utreshimon passes on overhead unless he notices the party travelling with the forces of Iuz, or openly flying Iuz's banner, in which case he swoops down and engages them in combat. If the roll on the Utreshimon Encounters table was a 5, the dragon is flying low enough to use his Frightful Presence ability on any creatures he can see.

And thus it came to pass in those days that the One Named Only in Whispers looked upon his tortured domain and saw that there was much amiss. Woe to those in that realm in those days, for cities were laid waste and the earth itself rebelled against man, all at the behest of the Dying King. The dark and forbidden land had prospered a little, as the Whispered One's attention had been in the endless wars that he waged, and his lieutenant had likewise entreated other lands with his cruel considerations. Now that the sinister lord's gaze turned back to Cavitius, the foul place became even more befouled. While the mad and unspeakable Kas continued to crush the enemies of his dread master, the Dying King looked upon his own homeland and saw that there existed matters which required his cursed attentions. One wrong in the dark master's eyes was that the Book of Inverted Darkness had slipped from his evil grasp. Sorcery great and vile located the baleful tome of the Ancient Brethren and brought it back into the skeletal clutches of the Master of the Spider Throne. Restoring it to its rightful place with his other darkling treasures, he placed the book in that sorrowful place which some name the Shadowed Room, where few can go and fewer can leave. The Whispered One holds the key to this hidden chamber of forlorn secrets, as do his most faithful of servants. The key, it is said, is likewise a secret, and the umbra of the dark mystery that holds the way into the Shadowed Room lies deep within the fact that there is no way in at all. After the fall of Regelios and the Night of Golden Death, ... Dyvers' harbour is absolutely packed since so many ships had to find berth as the ice spread. Some ships were stranded out in the ice, boxed in as it spread. The ice didn't spread supernaturally fast or anything, but it never happens and no one was prepared. Evard the Black Evard is also looking for the Rotted Tower and the secrets it holds, he's travelling with: Darmir Minddust (Duergar Soulblade, he/him) Kaitnura Helltale (Duergar Soulblade, they/them) Hardir Doomhand (Duergar Mind Master, he/him) Jendora Starkhunt (Duergar Stone Guard, she/her) Brynsyl Starkhunt (Duergar Stone Guard, she/her) (Names from FantasyNameGenerators.com) NOTE: Originally wrote Evard in when this part was set in the Sheldomar Valley and the Rushmoors, because that's where he operates. When this section was moved because of relocating the Rotted Tower, I brought him along because I was excited to use him. Ice Encounters Stranded sailors trying to make it to shore Stranded sailors still on their ship (Young) Dragon Turtle Kraken priests and Juvenile kraken Skill challenge: Navigate around breaks in the ice being caused by enormous monster underneath (intent is to show how dangerous the open waters of the Nyr Dyv are) The Rotted Tower Even though Vecna's actual seat of power, and thereby the location of his Spidered Throne, was his palace in the city of Cavitius (Southeast of modern-day Critwall), the Rotted Tower was where he spent most of his time. There he delved deep into arcane lore, magical study, and horrific experimentation that led him to much of his mastery and power. Aside from Kas, Acererak, and a handful of other apprentices lost to history, few were ever granted audience in the Tower, and even fewer ever returned. (VR says the city on Oerth was called Ykrath, but we have established it was Cavitius. Instead, we'll say that the true name of the Rotted Tower is Ykrath) Map: Dyson Logos \"The Shattered Tower\" Imply that the 5th and 6th floor (between which is the break) weren't originally consecutive. A lot of this tower is missing in the middle Additionally, the tower continues all the way to the floor of the Nyr Dyv. It is unclear how to travel below floor 1. 1st to 3rd floors are under water, freezing cold but somehow still liquid despite the ice outside being much (several feet) thicker imply that there were further floors beneath the \"1st\" in the past, and even that it expanded into a wider structure below Entrance through hole in wall of floor 4 Floor 4 is icy Upper section sways in the wind Each floor is ~15 feet from floor to ceiling Walls are slate grey stone Lighting: Exterior areas are lit with outdoor light according to time of day. Otherwise no lighting unless otherwise noted. Even in the centuries since Vecna's defeat at the hand of Kas, this site is one of great magic and untold evil. The dead, including the archlich's former servants, still linger here. In addition, the entirety of the Tower counts as desecrated ground (DMG ch5). Undead in the tower have advantage on all saving throws. If Zarenival and/or Cochort are alive and still after the party, they will take any opportunity to trouble them in the Tower. Triggering traps, alerting enemies, opening/closing doors at inopportune times, etc. Underwater floors: Frigid Water rules in DMG chapter 5, but because magic and just how cold it is: - cold resistance does not auto-succeed saves, only advantage - count by round not by minute, saves start after # rounds = Con modifier Areas of the Tower Floor 1 This floor is entirely underwater. See the rules for underwater floors above. Stairs down from Floor 2 meet in a T at a landing in front of eroded statue of Vecna as a lich at the height of his power Doors under stairs leading to the complex below the tower, magically sealed and cannot be opened. The Thing in the Shaft. A large, fleshy, blobby mass is settled into one corner of the entranceway, covered in short tendrils that drift gently in the water currents. Long ago, Narek was Kas' bastard son. Now, it is the Thing in the Shaft, having escaped its imprisonment in the complex deep below when Vecna was struck down. Once a creature gets within 10 ft. it notices an eye open on the blob If trying to flee, hundreds of eyes open and Narek attacks Narek will attack the nearest creature, grab it, then continue with the others (if any) until it reaches the surface Once in a target-rich environment, Narek prioritizes: a) Anyone attuned to a Sword of Kas, driven by hatred for its father b) Threats to its destruction of (a) Floor 2 This floor is entirely underwater. See the rules for underwater floors above. Largely empty. Scattered bits of broken wood and stone, destroyed by centuries underwater Floor 3 This floor is entirely underwater. See the rules for underwater floors above. Largely empty Random detritus Huge, completely faded tapestry on wall Can possibly be recovered and restored Floor 4 This is the floor that the party is able to enter through, thanks to a huge hole in the exterior wall Due to either the tower sinking or the Nyr Dyv rising, this floor is now level with the surface of the lake An enormous round hole pierces the outer shell of the tower as if it had been scooped out. Centuries of being lapped at and sprayed by the surface of the Nyr Dyv have thoroughly worn and weathered the stonework, and the floors and walls are now coated in slick ice. Whatever these rooms once were is now impossible to identify. Slippery ice, more than outside. DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) when moving or fall prone Rooms connected to hole are completely empty Room behind doors is similarly empty except for the skeletal remains of two humanoids, half-encased in the ice DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) : skeletons are much newer than the tower's destruction, less than a century old Spiral staircase: Up: Difficult ice stops partway up the stairs. Continues to Floor 5 Down: Surface of liquid water, somehow unfrozen, halfway down the second step. Continues to Floor 3 Floor 5 This floor is almost entirely exposed to the elements, and little of it remains. What remains of the stone walls is thin and largely rubble. A large portion of the floor has given away and is open to the level below. Some twenty or more feet above, the rest of the Tower floats in the air, shifting side to side as the wind gusts against it and it fights to stay in place. A sizable gap where the stone has crumbled away is visible in the floor of the bottom level. Barely anything of note here. The party needs some way to get up to the next level, most likely through that hole. Can then drop a rope/ladder/rope-ladder down for anyone who needs help up. Flight, teleportation, whatever. Floor 6 Entry: Entering through gap in floor to another pair of severely weathered rooms, almost nothing of note in them other than the door that is still in good shape Ladder/rope/rope-ladder can be attached and dropped down to lower floor Past the door: Completely different other than everything being really dusty Walls are seamless, smooth stone DC 15 Perception will notice molding of a serpent along where the floor meets the curved outer wall If lights are lit, there is a shadow in the corner that cannot be dispersed. This is the Shadow Demon Threndilla Threndilla. At the height of Vecna's power, Threndilla was the Steward of the Rotted Tower. At that time she was a Marilith, but she was destroyed along with most of the Tower in the blast released by Kas striking Vecna down. Having been bound to the Tower by Vecna, her body was unable to reform in the Abyss and so she reformed as a Shadow Demon over the years that followed and has haunted the ruins in that form ever since. The fiend is still fiercely loyal to Vecna, who she refers to only as \"the Master\", but will not fight the party unless provoked. Even so, she knows she is weaker in this form than she used to be and will flee if hurt. Threndilla has an intense hatred for Kas and will make this known, taking it out on anyone wielding his sword The Sword(s) of Kas will strongly seek her destruction It's been a very long time since Threndilla has had company \"Few others have come to Ykrath in centuries\" Threndilla speaks fondly of Acererak, calls him \"dear\". They were lovers before he left the Tower to begin some great project of his off to the East She is not aware that Vecna is making his return, but does sense is presence on this plane more strongly than ever since he was struck down Cooperates with the party for survival, but will also task them with removing the lingering apprentices on floors 8 and 9 They have forsaken Vecna even while they live in the Tower and she will not stand by that, but cannot defeat them on her own Banners. Along the straight center wall are three banners on stands (rectangles on map), all faded with age but still identifiable. In order from left to right: A simple black down-pointed sword on a white circle surrounded by a black field. Kas' personal banner. It has been shredded and hangs in multiple pieces from its hanger. Threndilla went at it with her claws in anger at his betrayal not long after she reformed, but she refuses to remove the banner because that is where it's supposed to be. She says she cannot let her personal feelings come ahead of her duties as Steward, if asked. A twisting black ouroboros in the center of a blood-red field. Higher and larger than the two others. Vecna's personal banner, and the emblem of the Occluded Empire. ~~A large slash runs diagonally across the top of it, at one point severing it from the stand entirely. A DC 13 Perception check reveals that the two pieces are now held together by what seems to be physical shadowstuff. It was destroyed by Kas when he climbed the Tower intent on betrayal, and repaired by Threndilla in the years since~~ By this point the party should be realizing that this serpent motif has been showing up repeatedly in association with Vecna, and put together that it must have been his symbol before his Hand and Eye became important since that only occurred with Kas' betrayal If asked about the Serpent, Threndilla tells the party (paraphrased from VR4, characters may remember a similar passage from reading the Book of Pain): > The Serpent spoke directly to the Master. Some who dare call themselves mages only manipulate the tiniest aspects of the Serpent and call it magic. But the Master spoke to the Serpent, and the Serpent spoke back. It told him tales of his ancestors, the Ancient Brethren, and of how they discovered the Serpent so unimaginably long ago, when all worlds were young or even unborn. And I'm sure it continues to speak to him even now. The Sword(s) of Kas emanate hatred at the sight of this banner A green, horned, bearded face with a gaping mouth on a black field. Acererak's personal banner. ~~Similar to Vecna's, a large slash from Kas split this banner once and has since been repaired by Threndilla (noticeable with a DC 13 Perception check)~~ TODO: Re: crossed out points. Did Kas come through the Tower for the Betrayal, or did he enter the Shadowed Room through the Palace, then Vecna fought him out into the Tower? In our campaign, the non-Kas banners being slashed did not come up, so he didn't have to come through there. It probably makes more sense that he didn't. Once this is decided, clean things up and make sure it's all consistent. Stairs. A wide, curved staircase continues upward to Floor 7. Threndilla will explicitly follow the group if asked, otherwise she'll incorporeally keep an eye on them and chime in when relevant Floor 7 Enter up stairs into open circular room with four pillars in the middle and two protrusions from the walls Stairs continuing upwards on the other side of the room Farthest pillar (closest to the upwards stairs) appears to be carved in the relief of a large armored skeletal figure It actually is a large armored skeletal figure in a niche formed in the pillar, but it's covered in dust Other three pillars have a mosaic of a serpent wound around them in colored tiles Barrier. As soon as a creature reaches the top of the stairs, a wavering, spectral barrier of slowly moving runes splits the room, from the protrusion in one wall to another. A raspy voice speaking directly into the mind of the creature, in their preferred language, says \"Only those who sing the praises of the Whispered One may pass\". Let the party's imagination fill in what the threat of the trap is A creature must make \"some sort of verbal supplication towards the greatness of Vecna\" to pass through the barrier without issue A creature who truly is dedicated to Vecna can speak some praise and pass through undeterred Technically a PC could do this, but the prerequisite (dedication to Vecna) would have severe repercussions A creature who isn't dedicated to Vecna can attempt a DC 25 Charisma (Deception) check to fool the barrier of their devotion A creature who doesn't put the effort in, or fails the Deception check, attempting to pass through the barrier will awaken the phylaskia in the far pillar Much of the dust falls away when it animates Balcony. Maybe there's a monster here? Maybe not? the balcony can mostly just be there as a way to fly up and around to the next balcony if the party really wants to avoid the barrier Floor 8 Enter into curved passageway from stairs up from Floor 7 Outer wall has the figures of many different demons lined up along it, all in different poses Vrock (1-2) Barlgura (3-4) Glabrezu (5-8) Marilth (9-14) Herozu (15-16) Balor (17-18) Inner wall is smooth DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check (or passive) will locate the outline of a secret door in the wall, but not how to open it At the other end of the curved passage are the stairs up to Floor 9 Secret Door. Opening the secret door requires pulling on \"the third fiend's claw\" Count from the stairs up Third claw, not claw of the third fiend Keeping this puzzle basically unchanged because I like how silly it is Pulling any incorrect claw causes the triggering creature to take 2d6 force damage Correct claw opens the door Secret Room. Some sort of laboratory Various arcane apparatuses standing around, most of them hovering slightly to allow them to move On a cabinet nearest the door is a closed transparent glass box with three oddly-shaped orbs made of dark red glass inside it The apprentices made them (see notes on the apprentices and the Shadowed Room), probably out of the Boneclaw somehow? On the far end of the room are several pillars, suspended between which is a stretched-out, partially-flayed, humanoid figure Broken and exposed bones, long limbs, enormous claws Coagulated blood collected in a trough below it If anything in the room is moved, it disrupts the boneclaw which wakes up, breaks free, and attacks Turn 1 it gets surprise but uses its first attack to break free Other Rooms. Only accessible through ladder from Floor 9 One is Meshivi's quarters, very barebones The other is a lab/work area Floor 9 Enter up from Floor 8 into a large figure-8 shaped room Arcane glyphs and diagrams decorate the walls, floor, ceilings, and pillars Two skeletal robed figures mill about. One is attending to a spell on an altar, the other is reviewing a spell circle on the wall and notices anyone coming up the stairs unless sneaking On both sides of the door out to the balcony are banners of the Occluded Empire in exquisite condition, kept now as objects of worship for the apprentices Ladder down to remaining rooms of Floor 8 The Lingering Apprentices. After Kas' betrayal, several of Vecna's apprentices were left stranded in the upper levels of the tower until it drifted down towards the surface of the Nyr Dyv. These apprentices, feeling remorse at their failure to protect their master in the moment of his betrayal and desperate to continue living, attempted to rush their ascension to lichdom and in doing so became deathlocks . But as the centuries wore on they came to believe that Vecna had instead failed them, and turned their devotion and study towards the Serpent, earning them the ire of Threndilla. Their belief is that if they are able to produce sufficiently impressive arcane feats, it will earn them the attention of the Serpent as Vecna once did. Meshivi: deathlock mastermind , they/them, out brooding on balcony. The leader of the cabal due to seniority, the most devoted to their current mission Am: deathlock , they/them, attending to the altar Bevom: deathlock , they/them, down in lab on Floor 8 working Cezeluh: deathlock , they/them, reviewing the spell circle on the wall At one point they counted seven in total, but the other three proved to be unworthy of the Serpent and had their power, intelligence, and personalities drained to empower the others. The names of those three are now forgotten, but they linger still as deathlock wights . Meshivi does most of the talking The apprentices do not want to fight, they need help They have all but exhausted the resources of the parts of the tower they have access to, using nearly everything as spell components This helps explain why there isn't any loot anywhere They cannot get up to Level 11 without the teleporter, but it is inoperable and they haven't been able to restart it Threndilla refuses to fix it for them (or she doesn't know how to? or she's saying she knows to piss them off but actually doesn't know?) Offer the party safe passage and any loot they want from the upper levels in exchange for their help If asked, will give the instructions for the secret door on Floor 8 as a show of good faith \"Pull down on the third fiend's claw\" Intentionally vague, see above If asked about the three items in the case from the secret room, they will explain that they created them to be used in \"the Mirror Dance\" to re-enter the Shadowed Room. That's the only reason they haven't used them as spell components Implication: Vecna had some other, less silly way of entering the Shadowed Room. The Mirror Dance was devised by these apprentices after the Betrayal entirely from memory so they could access it once they were able to get up to the upper floors. Describe the Shadowed Room as Vecna's personal library, accessible only to him. Floor 10 Mostly empty room, lots of scattered detritus Curved nook against one side An Echo of the Past. The arcane resonances tied to the teleporter causes a creature to experience a spectral vision of the past after about a minute in the room. The image of Vecna stumbles out of the teleporter and into the center of the room, then Kas leaps out of the teleporter after him, wielding a vicious dark shortsword and going for Vecna's back. The archlich snaps around and catches the blade in a magical shield, stopping Kas in his tracks before launching him into the wall. Then the vision fades. Cool scene plus helps establish the teleporter in case the party just kills the deathlocks Teleporter. An ancient, inactive teleporter is inscribed into the nook in the room, long dormant. Evard can reactivate it, he's good at conjuration magic, but it could take up to eight hours of work Otherwise, someone can fly up to the next floor's balcony and try to reactivate it from the other side Either way, as soon as it is active, the apprentices betray the party Floor 11 Characters will either enter from teleporter or balcony Threndilla can explain that since the apprentices don't come up here she's been able to keep this floor and the rest above very clean Balcony. Exposed to the elements At some point a group of wyverns came to roost here, they died and became transformed by the Tower's magic into gloamwings Drop gloamwings wherever on the balcony works best for action, but they can't go inside Teleporter Room. Not much here other than the teleporter. Good place to rest Library. A small library that was available to the apprentices in the past All the books are in Old Flan Also they all animate and attack ( Swarms of Animated Books ) Evard is insistent that they are dispatched without significant damage, otherwise untold knowledge may be lost Connecting Room. Nothing really here, just doors Laboratory. Mix between dissection room and torture chamber Many horrific experiments were carried out here by Vecna personally The echo of the centuries of torture carried out here have coalesced in the centuries since and manifest as a gallows speaker Floor 12 Threndilla will not come up here, says she was never allowed to without Vecna's express permission and is still bound by that Four huge, faded, banners, each with the symbol of the Occluded Empire Apparatus in front of one of the banners, three large mirrors that can be individually rotated (6-axis) Stairs up lead to Floor 13 through a large trapdoor in the floor This is the Mirror Room (VR50) with some changes The Mirror Dance. Each of the banners except the one behind the mirrors has a complete symbol inside the circle of the ouroboros Each mirror has a partial outline of a symbol somewhere on it Holding up the three \"orbs\" from the secret room on Floor 8 in the right place and orientation, and angling the mirrors right can line up the outlines and the objects to match the shapes Players don't need to actually match the mirrors/shapes/objects one-to-one, just realize the relationship, then: DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to match everything and find orientations DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hold the objects in the right place Once the Dance is completed, the room begins to spin. Everyone inside has their vision blur and darken. DC 20 Constitution saving throws or fall unconscious Once the spinning has stopped and/or consciousness regained, everyone finds themselves in the same room but different After the Dance. Same room, but stairs down are gone Stairs up still there, lead to the alternate version of Floor 13 (see The Shadowed Room) Where the banners were in the previous room are now windows NW Window: View from where the room is in physical space on top of the Tower, but at its past height of untold dozens if not hundreds of stories. In the distance, sprawled across the delta of the Veng River, is the vast city of Cavitius in its height just before the collapse of the Occluded Empire. At its center, a huge palace complex can be made out. NE and SW windows: View from atop the palace complex in Cavitius. \"a great fortress city, the likes of which was never seen again on that world-miles and miles of towers, castles, and cathedrals all dedicated to [Vecna].\" (VR50) SE Window: View from atop the palace complex in Cavitius towards the coast. In the distance, the silhouette of the Tower can just barely be seen, a ring of energy parallel to the surface is just beginning to expand out of it near the middle, but is frozen in time. The three stones used to get in have taken different shapes, now warped into full representations of the symbols made in the Mirror Dance Floor 13 Nothing. The room is entirely empty when first entered. It feels even more eerie and cold than the rest of the Tower. After the Shadowed Room. When the characters leave the Shadowed Room, they appear here. The room is the same as before except for the presence of a sinister rapier driven into the floor. The blade is unerringly straight and dark, catching the light with an iridescent sheen. The hilt is wrapped in blood-red leather. The guard is in the shape of a leering face, and sweeps down to the pommel to form a basket over the grip. This is the Sword of Kas (Rapier) aka the Sword of the Terrible When Kas committed to striking out against Vecna in the Shadowed Room, he dropped the guise of advisor (linked to the Rapier), which caused that aspect of the Sword to coalesce in the Shadowed Room. When the party breached the Shadowed Room using the Mirror Dance, it got spat back out, since nothing can be left behind in there. The Shadowed Room \"Remember, you can leave with no more or less than what you brought with you on your impossible journey, so learn what you need to while you are there.\" Spellcasting doesn't function within the Shadowed Room, but magic items do. Access. In his time, Vecna had his own method of entering the Shadowed Room, the full details of which only he knew. From their memories of the process, the apprentices on Floor 9 created three objects that are meant to essentially break through in a different way, partially bypassing Vecna's method. They have no idea if it will work, but haven't been able to try. Always existed outside of physical space, since the destruction of the Tower and the Betrayal now also exists outside of time Vecna's way allowed him to enter and exit from and to the Tower and his palace in Cavitius We're saying here that the Betrayal physically happened in the Tower, but the Tower and Palace were deeply linked because of this This helps explain things like Rwen's vision of the palace throne room through the window of the Tower Also moments after the Tower was destroyed by Vecna's downfall, the Palace was also destroyed (this aligns with VL60) Frozen at the instant Vecna was struck down by Kas The Library. Alternate version of Floor 13. Much larger, higher ceiling. Several levels. Lofts, etc. Lofts include various arcane workstations, dissection tables, etc. Maps of the political divisions of the Flanaess at this time, marked up with where Vecna has agents, is waging war, etc. Some shelves are toppled, books scattered, tables overturned Kas invaded the Shadowed Room as part of the Betrayal, Vecna fought him out of it and back into the real Tower Many windows. \"high in the air, a cloudy sky above you with the vast sprawl of a stone city below.\" (VR50) Many books are in Ancient Flan, others in many other ancient languages The Book of Vile Darkness. On a desk on an elevated platform near the center of the library Open, Vecna was in the process of transcribing a scroll, unfurled next to it on the table, into the book Anyone can read it because of the magic within, but it is difficult to understand DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check to find the relevant passage after 1d4 + (18 - the reader's Intelligence score) hours Thus, though the words are many, in this case there are three. The first of the Three Words must be preceded by the Ritual of Recession, and requires speaker's hands to be red with the blood of an outsider spilled in violence. The second of the Three Words requires a plague to ravage the land. This plague must be without mercy, its survivors clinging to life through fortune alone. The Ritual of Cavernous Thought must be performed upon the pyre of diseased souls, and then can the second of the Three Words be uttered. The time for the speaking of the final Word comes after the murder of a king. Upon his death, the Ritual of Lorn Malison must be performed, and the last of the Three Words spoken. Then, and only then, can a long-dead wizard, great in power and like unto a god, be born anew in woman's womb. Thus born, he is free of whatever shackles or chains bound him before\u2014free to go and do as he pleases. No power, no magic, no force, not even death, can hold him then. How is the Book of Vile Darkness Here? The Book of Vile Darkness found here is an early draft, Vecna's personal work at the frozen moment in time that the Shadowed Room now exists in. In the destruction of the Tower and Palace, and thereby the destabilization of the magics that created the Shadowed Room, the actual manuscript was ejected from the extradimensional space, likely into the ruins of the palace in Cavitius. In the years that followed, as Cavitius was invaded and razed, the book was found and thus began its legend. It exchanged hands many times, each evil being who possessed it adding more to the knowledge contained inside. We are under the assumption that there is only a single Book of Vile Darkness. But if you would like to say that there are many, it's possible that the manuscript was ejected from the Shadowed Room at more than one time or place. Leaving. Nothing can be left behind, nothing can be taken Can't leave through the windows or through the walls in any way. Extradimensional spaces cannot be accessed. Can't teleport out. Can't get through the walls, floors, or ceilings. Spells don't work anyways. The mirrors on Floor 12 aren't in the parallel The three stones used to get in have taken different shapes, now warped into full images of the symbols made in the Mirror Dance All three stones must be shown to a mirror or any reflective surface If the characters don't have one, one can be found after 1d4 hours of searching in the form of a highly metallic book Experience of leaving is the same as arriving No matter which floor they are on when leaving, they appear on Floor 13 Leaving the Tower If Narek hasn't already been dealt with, the presence of two Swords of Kas as the party leave is enough to bring it out to attack the party (semi-party specific, since it's not written in that Cylene is with the Rhennee, that's just for us) If there isn't already enough urgency from the party putting together that Virianis Dast and Cylene are in danger, have the party (somehow, again this is party-specific) be contacted by the Rhennee that they are under attack Evard is a very good conjurer and can teleport all of them back to Verbobonc Narek (The Thing in the Shaft) (Although there's no shaft anymore in this version.)

And thus it came to pass in those days that the One Named Only in Whispers looked upon his tortured domain and saw that there was much amiss. Woe to those in that realm in those days, for cities were laid waste and the earth itself rebelled against man, all at the behest of the Dying King. The dark and forbidden land had prospered a little, as the Whispered One's attention had been in the endless wars that he waged, and his lieutenant had likewise entreated other lands with his cruel considerations. Now that the sinister lord's gaze turned back to Cavitius, the foul place became even more befouled. While the mad and unspeakable Kas continued to crush the enemies of his dread master, the Dying King looked upon his own homeland and saw that there existed matters which required his cursed attentions. One wrong in the dark master's eyes was that the Book of Inverted Darkness had slipped from his evil grasp. Sorcery great and vile located the baleful tome of the Ancient Brethren and brought it back into the skeletal clutches of the Master of the Spider Throne. Restoring it to its rightful place with his other darkling treasures, he placed the book in that sorrowful place which some name the Shadowed Room, where few can go and fewer can leave. The Whispered One holds the key to this hidden chamber of forlorn secrets, as do his most faithful of servants. The key, it is said, is likewise a secret, and the umbra of the dark mystery that holds the way into the Shadowed Room lies deep within the fact that there is no way in at all.

This is the Shadow Demon Threndilla Threndilla. At the height of Vecna's power, Threndilla was the Steward of the Rotted Tower. At that time she was a Marilith, but she was destroyed along with most of the Tower in the blast released by Kas striking Vecna down. Having been bound to the Tower by Vecna, her body was unable to reform in the Abyss and so she reformed as a Shadow Demon over the years that followed and has haunted the ruins in that form ever since. The fiend is still fiercely loyal to Vecna, who she refers to only as \"the Master\", but will not fight the party unless provoked. Even so, she knows she is weaker in this form than she used to be and will flee if hurt. Threndilla has an intense hatred for Kas and will make this known, taking it out on anyone wielding his sword The Sword(s) of Kas will strongly seek her destruction It's been a very long time since Threndilla has had company \"Few others have come to Ykrath in centuries\" Threndilla speaks fondly of Acererak, calls him \"dear\".

Along the straight center wall are three banners on stands (rectangles on map), all faded with age but still identifiable. In order from left to right: A simple black down-pointed sword on a white circle surrounded by a black field. Kas' personal banner. It has been shredded and hangs in multiple pieces from its hanger. Threndilla went at it with her claws in anger at his betrayal not long after she reformed, but she refuses to remove the banner because that is where it's supposed to be. She says she cannot let her personal feelings come ahead of her duties as Steward, if asked. A twisting black ouroboros in the center of a blood-red field. Higher and larger than the two others. Vecna's personal banner, and the emblem of the Occluded Empire. ~~A large slash runs diagonally across the top of it, at one point severing it from the stand entirely. A DC 13 Perception check reveals that the two pieces are now held together by what seems to be physical shadowstuff. It was destroyed by Kas when he climbed the Tower intent on betrayal, and repaired by Threndilla in the years since~~ By this point the party should be realizing that this serpent motif has been showing up repeatedly in association with Vecna, and put together that it must have been his symbol before his Hand and Eye became important since that only occurred with Kas' betrayal If asked about the Serpent, Threndilla tells the party (paraphrased from VR4, characters may remember a similar passage from reading the Book of Pain): > The Serpent spoke directly to the Master. Some who dare call themselves mages only manipulate the tiniest aspects of the Serpent and call it magic. But the Master spoke to the Serpent, and the Serpent spoke back. It told him tales of his ancestors, the Ancient Brethren, and of how they discovered the Serpent so unimaginably long ago, when all worlds were young or even unborn. And I'm sure it continues to speak to him even now. The Sword(s) of Kas emanate hatred at the sight of this banner A green, horned, bearded face with a gaping mouth on a black field. Acererak's personal banner. ~~Similar to Vecna's, a large slash from Kas split this banner once and has since been repaired by Threndilla (noticeable with a DC 13 Perception check)~~ TODO: Re: crossed out points. Did Kas come through the Tower for the Betrayal, or did he enter the Shadowed Room through the Palace, then Vecna fought him out into the Tower? In our campaign, the non-Kas banners being slashed did not come up, so he didn't have to come through there. It probably makes more sense that he didn't.

The room is entirely empty when first entered. It feels even more eerie and cold than the rest of the Tower. After the Shadowed Room. When the characters leave the Shadowed Room, they appear here. The room is the same as before except for the presence of a sinister rapier driven into the floor. The blade is unerringly straight and dark, catching the light with an iridescent sheen. The hilt is wrapped in blood-red leather. The guard is in the shape of a leering face, and sweeps down to the pommel to form a basket over the grip. This is the Sword of Kas (Rapier) aka the Sword of the Terrible When Kas committed to striking out against Vecna in the Shadowed Room, he dropped the guise of advisor (linked to the Rapier), which caused that aspect of the Sword to coalesce in the Shadowed Room. When the party breached the Shadowed Room using the Mirror Dance, it got spat back out, since nothing can be left behind in there.","title":"Floor 13"},{"location":"vr/5-the-clutches-of-vecna/#the-shadowed-room","text":"\"Remember, you can leave with no more or less than what you brought with you on your impossible journey, so learn what you need to while you are there.\" Spellcasting doesn't function within the Shadowed Room, but magic items do. Access. In his time, Vecna had his own method of entering the Shadowed Room, the full details of which only he knew. From their memories of the process, the apprentices on Floor 9 created three objects that are meant to essentially break through in a different way, partially bypassing Vecna's method. They have no idea if it will work, but haven't been able to try. Always existed outside of physical space, since the destruction of the Tower and the Betrayal now also exists outside of time Vecna's way allowed him to enter and exit from and to the Tower and his palace in Cavitius We're saying here that the Betrayal physically happened in the Tower, but the Tower and Palace were deeply linked because of this This helps explain things like Rwen's vision of the palace throne room through the window of the Tower Also moments after the Tower was destroyed by Vecna's downfall, the Palace was also destroyed (this aligns with VL60) Frozen at the instant Vecna was struck down by Kas The Library. Alternate version of Floor 13. Much larger, higher ceiling. Several levels. Lofts, etc. Lofts include various arcane workstations, dissection tables, etc. Maps of the political divisions of the Flanaess at this time, marked up with where Vecna has agents, is waging war, etc. Some shelves are toppled, books scattered, tables overturned Kas invaded the Shadowed Room as part of the Betrayal, Vecna fought him out of it and back into the real Tower Many windows. \"high in the air, a cloudy sky above you with the vast sprawl of a stone city below.\" (VR50) Many books are in Ancient Flan, others in many other ancient languages The Book of Vile Darkness. On a desk on an elevated platform near the center of the library Open, Vecna was in the process of transcribing a scroll, unfurled next to it on the table, into the book Anyone can read it because of the magic within, but it is difficult to understand DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check to find the relevant passage after 1d4 + (18 - the reader's Intelligence score) hours Thus, though the words are many, in this case there are three. The first of the Three Words must be preceded by the Ritual of Recession, and requires speaker's hands to be red with the blood of an outsider spilled in violence. The second of the Three Words requires a plague to ravage the land. This plague must be without mercy, its survivors clinging to life through fortune alone. The Ritual of Cavernous Thought must be performed upon the pyre of diseased souls, and then can the second of the Three Words be uttered. The time for the speaking of the final Word comes after the murder of a king. Upon his death, the Ritual of Lorn Malison must be performed, and the last of the Three Words spoken. Then, and only then, can a long-dead wizard, great in power and like unto a god, be born anew in woman's womb. Thus born, he is free of whatever shackles or chains bound him before\u2014free to go and do as he pleases. No power, no magic, no force, not even death, can hold him then. How is the Book of Vile Darkness Here? The Book of Vile Darkness found here is an early draft, Vecna's personal work at the frozen moment in time that the Shadowed Room now exists in. In the destruction of the Tower and Palace, and thereby the destabilization of the magics that created the Shadowed Room, the actual manuscript was ejected from the extradimensional space, likely into the ruins of the palace in Cavitius. In the years that followed, as Cavitius was invaded and razed, the book was found and thus began its legend. It exchanged hands many times, each evil being who possessed it adding more to the knowledge contained inside. We are under the assumption that there is only a single Book of Vile Darkness. But if you would like to say that there are many, it's possible that the manuscript was ejected from the Shadowed Room at more than one time or place. Leaving. Nothing can be left behind, nothing can be taken Can't leave through the windows or through the walls in any way. Extradimensional spaces cannot be accessed. Can't teleport out. Can't get through the walls, floors, or ceilings. Spells don't work anyways. The mirrors on Floor 12 aren't in the parallel The three stones used to get in have taken different shapes, now warped into full images of the symbols made in the Mirror Dance All three stones must be shown to a mirror or any reflective surface If the characters don't have one, one can be found after 1d4 hours of searching in the form of a highly metallic book Experience of leaving is the same as arriving No matter which floor they are on when leaving, they appear on Floor 13","title":"The Shadowed Room"},{"location":"vr/5-the-clutches-of-vecna/#leaving-the-tower","text":"If Narek hasn't already been dealt with, the presence of two Swords of Kas as the party leave is enough to bring it out to attack the party (semi-party specific, since it's not written in that Cylene is with the Rhennee, that's just for us) If there isn't already enough urgency from the party putting together that Virianis Dast and Cylene are in danger, have the party (somehow, again this is party-specific) be contacted by the Rhennee that they are under attack Evard is a very good conjurer and can teleport all of them back to Verbobonc","title":"Leaving the Tower"},{"location":"vr/5-the-clutches-of-vecna/#narek-the-thing-in-the-shaft","text":"(Although there's no shaft anymore in this version.)
