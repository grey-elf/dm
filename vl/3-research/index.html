<p>Due to its strange shape seeming appropriate for the Wizard's Guild, <a href="https://dysonlogos.blog/2016/05/27/the-great-library/">The Great Library</a> by Dyson Logos is an appropriate map for this library if one is needed. Expansion can be taken <a href="https://dysonlogos.blog/2016/05/31/beneath-the-great-library/">Beneath the Great Library</a> if desired.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="grey-college">Grey College</h3>
<p>blah blah blah...  </p>
<p>Also at the College is Arklan Sammal (LN human <strong>master sage</strong>, he/him) who is a historian of some repute and a professor of Baklunish history at the school. He is also Rary's younger brother.  </p>
<h3 id="the-great-library-of-greyhawk">The Great Library of Greyhawk</h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Map</p>
<p>Should a map of the Great Library be required, Dyson Logos' <a href="https://dysonlogos.blog/2016/08/05/the-grand-library-of-coruvon/">The Grand Library of Coruvon</a> would make a good choice. As a mundane civilian library it has a more normal architecture, which helps contrast it with the stranger Library of the Wizard's Guild.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-books">The Books</h3>
<p>In order to gain information from any of the books a character must be able to read the language the book is written in, either by knowing the language or a related dialect, or using an ability such as the warlock's <em>Eyes of the Runekeeper</em>. If the character knows only a related dialect, any scanning checks are made at disadvantage and fully reading the book takes the maximum possible time. If a character relies on <em>comprehend languages</em> to read or scan a book, the time to do so is doubled.  </p>
<p>If the characters are unable to read or understand the importance of any of the books, they should think to seek out experts in the city for aid.  </p>

</ul>
<h2 id="wizards-homes">Wizards' Homes</h2>
<p>Three of the members of the Circle of Eight have homes in Greyhawk that they inhabit with varying degrees of permanency. Depending on which member of the Circle they were connected to, members of the party may know of some or all of these. Otherwise, they might find directions through other means.  </p>
<h3 id="jallarzi-sallavarian">Jallarzi Sallavarian</h3>
<p>Jallarzi's mansion is in the city's High Quarter, at H16. It is described on GoF61.  </p>
<p>Jallarzi sent her servants on vacation before she left with the rest of the Circle of Eight. Her vast but unfurnished house is uninhabited except for Edwina, her pseudodragon familiar she left behind because of her not getting along with Otiluke.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Edwina</p>
<p>Edwina is Jallarzi's familiar, a wild pseudodragon that the wizard befriended some time ago. This means she cannot be dismissed or summoned using the <strong><em>find familiar</em></strong> spell. Edwina has the stats of a <strong>pseudodragon (familiar variant)</strong>. When found, she will be immediately friendly with any member of the party who is not Otiluke's contact, but she will become especially attached to one of them, in the following order of preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character who is Jallarzi's contact</li>
<li>Any elf or halfling that is not Otiluke's contact</li>
<li>Any other character that is not Otiluke's contact</li>
<li>The character who is Otiluke's contact</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindness from Otiluke's contact will eventually earn Edwina's favour, and she will not stay friendly with any member of the party who is unkind to her. If the character she initially attached to is cruel or unkind to her, she will abandon the party.<br />
With some effort, the character that Edwina became attached to can earn her trust and gain her as a familiar. Until this happens, that character does not get the benefits of her <em>familiar</em> trait.  </p>
</div>
<p>The mansion is largely unfurnished aside from the parlour, master suite, and a few guest suites. The master suite and two of the guest suites show evidence of having been lately occupied and not cleaned since.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">What Edwina knows</p>
<ul>
<li>Jallarzi was very concerned with whatever she and the other wizards were investigating, but glad for the chance to prove herself</li>
<li>Tenser and Rary both stayed with Jallarzi in the house</li>
<li>She accompanied Jallarzi on trips to Grey College and the Guild library, as well as meetings with the other Circle members in the house, at the Guild, and elsewhere</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="otto">Otto</h3>
<p>Otto's cottage is in the city's Garden Quarter, at G2. It is described on GoF63.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">What the groundkeepers know</p>
<ul>
<li>Otto was staying for several weeks and seemed much more frantic than usual</li>
<li>He left a couple weeks ago and hasn't been seen since, which isn't unusual for him</li>
<li>He was meeting up with various other wizard-types, but particularly closely with a short, small-looking one (Otiluke) came by often</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="otiluke">Otiluke</h3>
<p>Otiluke's house is in the city's River Quarter, at R15. It is described on GoF83.  </p>
<p>The house is inhabited by a handful of servants and a young woman named Glorial. Glorial (CG human <strong>apprentice wizard</strong>, she/her) is roughly half Otiluke's age (early 20s), and has been living with the older mage for nearly one and a half years now as his apprentice and, more recently, concubine. (Otiluke is a creep.)  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">What Glorial knows</p>
<ul>
<li>Otiluke was frantically investigating something with a group of other wizards she didn't recognize.</li>
<li>He was spending a lot of time with a curly-haired fat one (Otto) at Grey College.</li>
<li>They also visited several temples in the city. She's not sure which but assumes the House of Boccob to be a good place to start.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="street">Street</h2>
<h3 id="the-river-quarter">The River Quarter</h3>
<h4 id="the-rhennee">The Rhennee</h4>
<ul>
<li>The priests of Trithereon or Olidammara know Yagos Slevak specifically</li>
<li>The clannishness of the Rhennee makes questioning them difficult</li>
<li>Asking about Almarth the Halt or Yagos Slevak will get back to them, and they will be smuggled out of the city</li>
<li>Best way to get info is through an introduction, like through one of the temples. Xerbo is a good one for this</li>
<li>Questions about the cult to non-cultists are met by fear and apprehension</li>
<li>No matter how they approach questioning the Rhennee, they are eventually approached by Turim Varostak</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">What the Rhennee Know</p>
<ul>
<li>Call the Cult of Vecna "The Cult of the Seeing Hand"</li>
<li>Know the cult to be an evil group that has been gaining traction among their clan (though won't name names, and don't know any in specific)</li>
<li>Know of <strong>the Eye</strong> and <strong>the Hand</strong>, and tell their children of them to scare them, but believe them to be real</li>
<li>Recommend going to Dyvers or Verbobonc for more information, cult is more active there</li>
<li>Remember wizards nosing around the waterfront some weeks ago</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h5 id="turim-varostak">Turim Varostak</h5>
<p>Turim Varostak (LE human <strong>lich</strong>, he/him) is Vecna's manifestation on Oerth. He appears to be a tall, grizzled, wiry human sailor with thinning white hair and a permanent scowl. He is an honorary Rhennee, a fact indicated by a charm he wears dangling from his belt. His entire left side is badly scarred and mutilated. He has a peg in place of his left leg, a leather cuff ending with a hook over his left forearm, and a patch over his left eye.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Claims to be a bargemaster</li>
<li>Has various different stories as to his injuries.</li>
<li>"A sahuagin attack down by Saltmarsh" etc.</li>
<li>Acts as if wanting to help, wants the party's help in tracking down Halmadar and regaining his place as the Voice</li>
<li>Knows information in "What the Rhennee Know" sidebar</li>
<li>After answering basics, he will disappear for a night and extract all information that Yagos knows, Yagos is found dead the next morning</li>
<li>Will only give Yagos' intel if party lets him come along on the journey (to avenge the honour of the clan that took him in) and offers his boat and crew</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="yagos-slevak">Yagos Slevak</h5>
<p>Yagos Slevak (NE Rhennee human <strong>master thief</strong>, he/him) is the leader of the Fingers of Vecna among the Rhennee and in the region. He is a weaselly, oily sycophant of a man who may seem helpless but is actually quite dangerous.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Rightfully mistrusted by most other Rhennee, but clannishness will still protect him unless outed as cultist</li>
<li>Will not reveal status as cultist of Vecna</li>
<li>Acts cooperative, hoping to lead the party into a trap far from the city</li>
<li>Knows information in "What the Rhennee Know" sidebar</li>
<li>Claims to have stumbled across a group of cultists in Verbobonc a few months ago</li>
<li>Pretends to be afraid of the cult and requires significant payment in advance for his services</li>
<li>Knows the location of the temple in Verbobonc and the rumors of Vecna's return</li>
<li>Knows of the importance of Osnabr√∂lt but doesn't know what's there</li>
<li>Hopes to stay alive by being useful, will keep information to himself but offers to take party there in person</li>
</ul>
<p>If his status as a cultist is made public, the Rhennee will turn on him. If they want his continued assistance, the party must negotiate for his life. This will only be allowed if the Rhennee can keep him under guard, requiring the party to travel with them.   </p>
<h5 id="almarth-the-halt">Almarth the Halt</h5>
<p>The players might recognize him from the attack at the Roc and Oliphant.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If exposed, meets the same end as Yagos</li>
<li>Knows as much as Yagos</li>
<li>Cannot be forced to talk</li>
<li>Won't go down without a fight</li>
<li>Will accidentally out Yagos as a co-conspirator if convinced that he was betrayed</li>
<li>Smuggled <strong>the Eye</strong> and <strong>the Hand</strong> into the city</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="avrel-riskar">Avrel Riskar</h5>
<p>Avrel Riskar (NG Rhennee human <strong>noble</strong>) is a Rhennee noble and a senior member of one of the clans currently in Greyhawk.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Could be found just asking around or through introduction by priests of Xerbo</li>
<li>Knows information in "What the Rhennee Know" sidebar</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-thieves-guild">The Thieves' Guild</h4>

<li>Very territorial. Active mostly in Old City and River Quarter</li>
<li>Will come down hard on anyone doing thief work on their turf</li>
<li>Will take notice of anyone asking questions but won't approach</li>
<li>Offer no information on events, despite knowing generally what has been happening. Don't want to be involved</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="the-beggars-union">The Beggars' Union</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can be hired to seek out information</li>
<li>No mention of cult, <strong>the Eye</strong>, <strong>the Hand</strong>, etc.: 10-50 gp</li>

<h4 id="the-shapechangers">The Shapechangers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Probably won't use, throw together later if needed</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-cults">The Cults</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vecna cultists take notice as soon as PCs start asking questions in River Quarter but do not act, awaiting orders</li>
<li>Stragglers of the Spurned Cult of Iuz take notice, first fearing that they are being targeted, but then becoming intrigued and eventually start tailing the party under orders from Iuz himself</li>
