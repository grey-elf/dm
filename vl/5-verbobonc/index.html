<h1 id="chapter-5-verbobonc">Chapter 5: Verbobonc</h1>
<p>Upon arriving in Verbobonc, the party's priority should be locating the cultists there. If they have ensured the Avrel they will track the cult to help regain his clan's reputation, or followed the information from Almarth that this is where he brought the cultists to Greyhawk from, this should be clear to them. But if they are fixated on the vague news they have from Osnabrölt or on the fate of the Circle of Eight, are confused, or are too focused on some other direction, they can be nudged in the right direction if required.  </p>
<p>If Turim is with the party and has either been told or somehow else found out that the party is seeking the Cult of Vecna, he immediately and very conspicuously begins asking around about the cult. It is in his best interest to do so, since even alerting the cult will help him find them and claim his rightful position as the <a href="../../overview/the-cult-of-vecna/#the-voice-of-vecna">Voice of Vecna</a>. This very quickly ensures that not only the cult, but other power groups in the city are aware of the party and their search.  </p>
<p>If the party arrived with Yagos ~~and are aware of his status as a cultist~~, he tells them that he will arrange a meeting with a contact of his within the cult that can get them to the temple in the city. The contact in question is <a href="../dramatis-personae/#oaklin-the-half-elf">Oaklin</a>. If allowed to meet privately, they make plans for Yagos to take the party to the Rock Powder Inn where they will rendezvous with Oaklin, who will then lead them to an ambush at the quarry at night, under the pretense of it being a cult ceremony and the party arriving as new inductees. If the two aren't allowed to converse in private, Yagos will meet Oaklin with any party members who wish to be present, and introduce them to Oaklin as potential new disciples. Yagos will attempt to secretly convey to Oaklin that they are actually enemies of the cult and need to be dealt with, his deception can be seen through by making a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by Yagos' Charisma (Deception) check. Characters who do not know thieves' cant make the check at disadvantage, and may be unable determine the actual meaning of the coded exchange. If the secret message is able to go by unnoticed and uninterrupted, Oaklin sets up the same plan as if the two of them were able to meet alone. <em>revision note: Yagos will play this slightly differently if he is known to be a cultist, or if he is acting as if he only knows about the cult and is acting out of fear of them.</em>  </p>
<h2 id="news-from-kieren">News from Kieren</h2>
<p>Whenever the party determines that they are in a safe location to do so, they can contact Kieren with a <em>sending</em> as indicated they should do when they were in transit. When they do so, if the <em>sending stone</em> was used, they might be surprised that the response comes in Mordenkainen's voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have to trust your determination of security, we cannot scry you. Wait. We will be making contact shortly, this is a complex ritual.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Kieren is specifically targeted with a <em>sending</em> spell, she conveys something similar in her own manner.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Alternate Approach (for my game, will probably cut from final)</p>
<p>Option: Instead, Mordenkainen's response is  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have arranged a meeting with the Bishop, he will be providing aid. Go to the Cathedral of St. Cuthbert, tell them Mordenkainen sent you.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When they do so, the characters are brought in by the priests (who were given descriptions of the party) to the Bishop's private garden. On a table is an assortment of finger foods. A few moments later the Bishop and Alimora come in. Once basic introductions are complete, the Bishop puts on a ring similar to the one that Kieren wore in Chapter 2, signaling to Mordenkainen that they are gathered, and the scene proceeds as below.  </p>
</div>
<p>Projected images of Mordenkainen and Kieren appear to the characters, meanwhile the two of them and Ravel Dasinder are in the peak of the pyramid that contains the Greyhawk University of Magical Arts.  </p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The divination blackout isn't just spreading, it's becoming more intense in places<ul>
<li>More and more divinations are starting to fail (lower and lower level spells)</li>
<li>Contact to the gods is becoming difficult (higher level cleric and paladin powers are failing)</li>
<li><em>insert other things here depending on how much time has passed and following progression from An Interlude earlier</em></li>
<li>Just this sort of telepresence is exceedingly difficult, the ritual is requiring all three of them to channel it in order to work, from a magically amplifying location (the wizard school), and even then it's unknown how long it will last</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is also spreading, blanketing more of the Flanaess<ul>
<li>List some countries affected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mordenkainen managed to track source of blackout to two sites</li>
<li>One was deep within the borders of Iuz, and already thoroughly controlled by the Old One's forces<ul>
<li>How was Iuz ahead of them in finding it? By the source being within its borders, the Empire of Iuz must have noticed and subsequently tracked and found the source faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The other was in southern Keoland, where Mordenkainen found it (maybe in the Dreadwood?)</li>
<li>Site was a ruined temple, serpent and eye-in-hand imagery were prevalent, indicates cult connection and longevity</li>
<li>In the temple, found a stone tablet that seems to be the specific source of the blackout</li>
<li>Moving the tablet from the temple moved the blackout epicenter with it</li>
<li>The tablet appears to describe some sort of ritual, it's imbued with extremely powerful magic, and is as old as it and the temple seem<ul>
<li>It's difficult to tell for sure, all divination magic fails too close to it, so spells like <em>identify</em> are useless</li>
<li>Relying on mundane observation and research instead</li>
<li>[Our campaign specific] This was confirmed by a second opinion from a contact of Nystul's in the church of Bleredd, who was also reached by the vision of the Circle falling<ul>
<li>Mordenkainen brought her to Verbobonc to meet them, she is waiting at the temple of Saint Cuthbert</li>
<li>The Bishop insists on knowing about the cult investigation, he has invited the party to lunch (whenever that makes sense to be)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For now, he has taken the tablet to his citadel in the Yatil Mountains for study, which has lessened the blackout over Greyhawk</li>

<p>Despite substantial mineral riches and significant trade power bringing much affluence to the Viscounty, not all of the region's residents are advantaged by this wealth, especially in the town of Verbobonc itself. Many were once caravaneers who lost their livelihoods to the vicious raids by the Horde of Elemental Evil in years past; others veterans of the Battle of Emridy Meadows some thirteen years past, who were left disabled and cast aside once the foe was routed; or adventurers left scarred and broken by the horrors of the Temple of Elemental Evil itself, which they delved into in effort to end the Horde's so-called "Second Rising" only a few years ago. They tend to settle near the town's docks, the most likely place for them to find shelter, work, or passage to better opportunity.  </p>
<p>Whatever the reason for their poverty, the arrogantly classist citizenry of Verbobonc try to overlook and ignore these destitute folk, leaving them to fend for themselves. Even the church of St. Cuthbert, so powerful in these lands, is more focused on stomping out evil than caring for the needy. As such, the poor and forgotten of Verbobonc have banded together, forging a strong comradery amongst themselves, working together and caring for each other's well-being. The epitome of this communal assistance is a man named Virianis Dast (NG Baklunish human <strong>commoner</strong>, he/him). Once a merchant and trader of significant respect, Virianis watched as his business died at the hands of the Horde's raids, eventually leaving him entirely bankrupt. He wasn't the first for this to happen to, and far from the last, but over time his cool head, humbleness, and kindness earned him no little respect as a mediator among the needy of Verbobonc, and a representative between them and the rest of the city. With his former connections among the Viscounty's merchant class and knack for logistics he also became something of a coordinator of how the community's resources are put to use. His position as a de facto leader of those living in poverty has earned him various titles, such as "the King of the Destitute," or "the Sultan of the Suffering." These were used derisively by the city at large but eventually accepted with some humor by Dast and his community.  </p>
<p>Even though he is later in his years, Virianis Dast spends much of his time moving about the city, mostly around the docks, checking on and catching up with the people of his community, asking after their concerns and making sure their needs are taken care of. Other times he can be found in a backroom of a particular warehouse down by the docks, the last remaining part of his old business that he has somehow managed to hold onto. The main space he shares with those who need it, offering them much-needed shelter, and in the back he makes his own quarters, meets with anyone who wishes to speak to him, and plans with others how to best distribute the community's resources. Virianis is rarely far from his "honor guard", rotating pairs of local teens (any non-evil alignment, any race <strong>thugs</strong>, any pronouns) who have taken it upon themselves to assist and protect him at all times. He has never asked them to do this, but allows them to do so and appreciates them immensely, he is very fond of them all.  </p>
