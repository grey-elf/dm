<h1 id="chapter-2-kron-hills">Chapter 2: Kron Hills</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The surrounding hillocks [of Verbobonc] still hold relics of those ancient days, slowly crumbling towers of unsurpassed beauty, troves of buried arrowheads and still-useful armor, and even, it is said, the elven Old Places, sacred refuges hidden in the magical folds of the world. [LGG132]  </p>
<p>The fertile upper reaches of the Kron Hills are home to some twenty thousand gnomes and scattered human farmers and herders. Once claimed by Verbobonc, the northern hills are now a realm unto itself, the so-called Free Assembly of the Kron Hills, ruled by the wise Urthgan the Eldest of Tulvar. The gnomes get on well with all local nonhumans; many gnomes are veterans of the Hateful Wars decades ago, and all are proud of their military traditions. Mineral wealth is plentiful throughout. [LGG145-146]  </p>
<p>It is estimated that nearly 20,000 gnomes live within the region of the Kron Hills. These heights spring eastward from the Lortmils and reach almost to Nyr Dyv. Their verge forms the southern boundary of Veluna, then stretches beside the Velverdyva for a time before peaking in the heart of the Gnarley Forest, where many Sylvan Elves happily roam over their crests. Their southern slopes demark the end of the Wild Coast region and are a part of the northern region of Celene. Some dwarven enclaves exist in the Kron Hills where they butt against the Lortmils, although the number of such demi-humans is not known. The gnomes of the region were instrumental in the organization of the army which drove the humanoid hordes from the Lortmils (and the Kron Hills). They likewise served with honor in the host which defeated the Horde of Elemental Evil in the battle above Verbobonc.<br />
The Kron Hills are mined for metals, precious metals, and gems. The upper slopes are quite fertile and grow many crops in sheltered valley and glen. Quite a number of scattered enclaves of humans live in peace with the gnomes and other demi-humans of the area, save in the Gnarley Forest, where the Olvenfolk are isolationist. [WoG49]  </p>

<h3 id="elven-remnants">Elven Remnants</h3>
<p>Long before humans came to Verbobonc, the surrounding land was claimed by the elves. The elves spread out into the hills, where they lived and treated with the gnomes of the area. While the elves retreated west into the Gnarley Forest and south into Celene when they chose to cede the land to the arriving humans, many remnants of those days still dot the Kron Hills. Roll a d8 and consult, or choose from, the <a href="#elven-remnant-sites">Elven Remnant Sites table</a> to determine what the characters encounter.  </p>
<p>Searching near the site of an elven remnant might turn up items from that bygone era, whether left there intentionally or lost in years past. Finding such hidden stashes requires a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Roll a d8 and consult, or choose from, the <a href="#ancient-elven-relics">Ancient Elven Relics table</a> to determine what the characters' searching uncovers.  </p>

<p>Typical merchants may look at the ancient coinage with some suspicion, but coin is still coin and spends just as well as modern currency. Optionally, a character may be required to make a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) to convince someone to accept the coins, or to make a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to use the coins without drawing question to their provenance. While these coins can still be spent according to their modern equivalences, they may hold even greater value to collectors.  </p>
<h3 id="feywild-crossings">Feywild Crossings</h3>
<p>While potentially more common in the Gnarley Forest to the east, there are places in the Kron Hills where the border between the Material Plane and the the Feywild is thin, sometimes thin enough for creatures to pass through and roam the hills as they please. Other times this proximity to the Plane of Faerie creates locations suffused with the magic of the fey. Some scholars wonder if this connection to the Feywild was what drew the elves to the region in the distant past, or if the elves were instead responsible for the crossings themselves.  </p>
<p>Roll a d8 and consult, or choose from, the <a href="#fey-crossings-encounters">Fey Crossings Encounters table</a> table to determine what effect of the Kron Hills' Feywild connection the characters encounter. The "Starting Attitude" column indicates the initial attitude any creatures mentioned in the corresponding entry have towards the characters. Entries that only include creatures assume that the creatures crossed over from the Feywild some time ago and have been going about the hills as they desire, the exact circumstances of these encounters are left up to you.  </p>

<h5 id="camprats">Camprats</h5>
<p>The camprat is a notorious vermin that inhabits the hills of the Flanaess. and the Kron Hills are no exception. Legends tell of a gnomish king who once dedicated a decade of his reign to ridding the Kron Hills of the creatures, to no avail. Camprats are rodents, exhibiting behavior similar in many ways to rats, but with an appearance more resembling a small gopher.  </p>
<p>Camprats are timid and pose little threat to adventurers, often preferring to flee rather than fight, unless cornered. The main difficulty camprats pose are simply as a nuisance. Active at night, relying only on scavenging to feed, and willing to go to any length to steal food, the camprat's tenacity, agility, and incredibly sharp teeth make sleeping travelers' supplies a common, and aggravating, target.  </p>
<p>An individual camprat has the statistics of a <strong>rat</strong>. A swarm of camprats have the statistics of a <strong>swarm of rats</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Running the Encounter.</em></strong> The characters wake in the morning to find their camp and supplies overrun with camprats. (TODO: Punch this up)  </p>
<h5 id="tanbrosh">Tanbrosh</h5>
<p>Native to the Kron Hills, tanbrosh is a flowering plant that can be processed into a powerful, and powerfully addictive narcotic.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Usage Effect: +2 Str and Con, -2 Wis  </li>
<li>Addiction: Wis save vs addiction on each use if not already addicted  </li>
<li>Withdrawal Effect: Each day that an addicted creature goes without a dose, gain one level of exhaustion that does not get removed by a long rest . Taking dose immediately removes exhaustion. Something to remove addiction like: Med check + herb kit, prevents exhaustion gain? Needs some consecutive days to fully remove?  </li>

<h3 id="utreshimon">Utreshimon</h3>
<p>Following the quelling of the "second rising" of the Temple of Elemental Evil in 579 CY, the village of Nulb has been all but abandoned. Between the abandoned village and the storied town of Hommlet stands an abandoned moathouse. This fortification was once integral to the defense of the region against the Temple's Hordes, but it too has now been abandoned. Seizing upon this opportunity, an <strong>adult blue dragon</strong> named Utreshimon has taken the keep as his new (perhaps second?) home. Utreshimon has only recently reached adulthood, and is still trying to establish his hold on the world.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Utreshimon in Canon</p>
<p>Utreshimon is a character introduced in the 3rd edition adventure <em>Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil</em> where he is a young blue dragon that had only made his home in the moathouse about a week before the events of the adventure. The choice here to make Utreshimon an older dragon, and to have him established in the region much earlier is to add a greater threat and additional player into the power dynamics of the Kron Hills.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I‚Äôm so pleased with myself and my own good fortune that I can‚Äôt stop laughing or chuckling.<br />
<strong>Ideal.</strong> Humor. Lesser beings exist to be my playthings, and I excel at finding ways to toy with them.<br />
<strong>Bond.</strong> I feel an obligation to protect the creatures that inhabit my territory (except the ones I eat).<br />
<strong>Flaw.</strong> Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep.  </p>
<p>Utreshimon tends not to target the intelligent inhabitants of the Kron Hills, knowing that if they and the powers of Verbobonc turn against him he could be driven out of his new home, or worse. At the same time, he is not too happy with the Iuzite activity all over what he considers his domain and has been venturing far out from his new lair to combat the roving troops, even spending days at a time without returning to the moathouse.  </p>

<td><strong>Prints.</strong> The dirt is marked by large footprints and the furrows of a dragged tail. If Utreshimon has not been seen before, a character who succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine the size of creature that would leave such prints, and a result of 15 or higher can determine that they were left by a dragon specifically. If he has been seen, the characters can easily assume that he left the prints.</td>

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine that the gouges were left by the claws of a massive creature. There is no certain way to tell what the creature is or was, but characters who have seen Utreshimon will likely make assumptions.</td>

<td><strong>Leveled foliage.</strong> All plant life in a roughly 20 foot radius circle has either been crushed or blasted away. Plants nearer the center of the area are flattened, while ones farther out have been blown outwards, losing leaves, branches, or even being uprooted entirely. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine that this effect was caused by the takeoff of a massive, winged creature. Characters who have seen Utreshimon can tell that he is the right size to be responsible.</td>

<td><strong>Droppings.</strong> Sizable droppings mark the hillside, either scattered or in a pile. Any creature who moves within 10 feet of the droppings must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for as long as it remains in the area. A creature who leaves the area must repeat the saving throw if it later reenters. Determining the size of creature that would leave such droppings requires a character to succeed on a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check, and a result of 18 or higher is required to draw the conclusion that it came from a dragon specifically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5-6</td>
<td><strong>Dead Iuz troops.</strong> A gruesome scene litters the area ahead, where the corpses of a group of Iuz's forces lie unmoving, killed by the dragon. Use the <a href="#iuzite-encounters">Iuzite Encounters table</a> to determine the bodies that are found (on a 1, roll again and those are the bodies found in the camp). A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Medicine) check can discover the causes of death: The vast majority, if not all, were killed by what appears to be concentrated lightning (the dragon's breath weapon), while the rest were torn apart with tooth and claw.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5 id="overhead">Overhead</h5>
<p>The characters notice the blue dragon flying overhead. The silhouette is unmistakable as that of a dragon, but a character must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to identify it as a blue dragon. Utreshimon notices the characters as well unless they are travelling through the Hills stealthily, in which case any character attempting to remain hidden must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the blue dragon's passive perception score. Utreshimon passes on overhead unless he notices the party travelling with the forces of Iuz, or openly flying Iuz's banner, in which case he swoops down and engages them in combat.  </p>
<p>If the roll on the Utreshimon Encounters table was a 5, the dragon is flying low enough to use his Frightful Presence ability on any creatures he can see. Even if he has no plans on engaging them, this is something he sometimes does for his own amusement to remind the creatures of the Hills of the pecking order. If the roll was a 4, he is too high up to use the ability.  </p>
<h5 id="in-the-flesh">In the Flesh</h5>
<p>Utreshimon engages with the characters directly, but is not hostile unless they appear to be in league with Iuz. Most likely, he will wish to speak to the party simply out of interest, possibly after having noticed them a few times (perhaps while staying unnoticed himself) during their trek through the Kron Hills. As long as the characters can assure the dragon that they hold no loyalty to Iuz, he lets them go unharmed, and even offers his protection above that if they convince him that they are actively working against Iuz in this region. If the dragon is unconvinced of the party's loyalties, or if he is attacked by them, he does not hold back in fighting them but will retreat rather than fight to the death.  </p></div>
