<blockquote>
<p>And thus it came to pass in those days that the One Named Only in Whispers looked upon his tortured domain and saw that there was much amiss. Woe to those in that realm in those days, for cities were laid waste and the earth itself rebelled against man, all at the behest of the Dying King. The dark and forbidden land had prospered a little, as the Whispered One's attention had been in the endless wars that he waged, and his lieutenant had likewise entreated other lands with his cruel considerations. Now that the sinister lord's gaze turned back to Cavitius, the foul place became even more befouled. While the mad and unspeakable Kas continued to crush the enemies of his dread master, the Dying King looked upon his own homeland and saw that there existed matters which required his cursed attentions. One wrong in the dark master's eyes was that the Book of Inverted Darkness had slipped from his evil grasp. Sorcery great and vile located the baleful tome of the Ancient Brethren and brought it back into the skeletal clutches of the Master of the Spider Throne. Restoring it to its rightful place with his other darkling treasures, he placed the book in that sorrowful place which some name the Shadowed Room, where few can go and fewer can leave. The Whispered One holds the key to this hidden chamber of forlorn secrets, as do his most faithful of servants. The key, it is said, is likewise a secret, and the umbra of the dark mystery that holds the way into the Shadowed Room lies deep within the fact that there is no way in at all. After the fall of Regelios and the Night of Golden Death, ...</p>

<p>Dyvers' harbour is absolutely packed since so many ships had to find berth as the ice spread.  </p>
<p>Some ships were stranded out in the ice, boxed in as it spread.  </p>
<p>The ice didn't spread supernaturally fast or anything, but it never happens and no one was prepared.  </p>

</ul>
<p>(Names from FantasyNameGenerators.com)</p>
<p>NOTE: Originally wrote Evard in when this part was set in the Sheldomar Valley and the Rushmoors, because that's where he operates. When this section was moved because of relocating the Rotted Tower, I brought him along because I was excited to use him.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-rotted-tower">The Rotted Tower</h2>
<p>Even though Vecna's actual seat of power, and thereby the location of his Spidered Throne, was his palace in the city of Cavitius (Southeast of modern-day Critwall), the Rotted Tower was where he spent most of his time. There he delved deep into arcane lore, magical study, and horrific experimentation that led him to much of his mastery and power. Aside from Kas, Acererak, and a handful of other apprentices lost to history, few were ever granted audience in the Tower, and even fewer ever returned.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Map: Dyson Logos "The Shattered Tower"</li>
<li>Imply that the 5th and 6th floor (between which is the break) weren't originally consecutive. A <em>lot</em> of this tower is missing in the middle</li>
<li>Additionally, the tower continues all the way to the floor of the Nyr Dyv. It is unclear how to travel below floor 1.</li>
<li>1st to 3rd floors are under water, freezing cold but somehow still liquid despite the ice outside being much (several feet) thicker<ul>
<li>imply that there were further floors beneath the "1st" in the past, and even that it expanded into a wider structure below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Entrance through hole in wall of floor 4</li>
<li>Floor 4 is icy</li>
<li>Upper section sways in the wind</li>
<li>Each floor is ~15 feet from floor to ceiling</li>
<li>Walls are slate grey stone</li>
<li>Lighting: Exterior areas are lit with outdoor light according to time of day. Otherwise no lighting unless otherwise noted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in the centuries since Vecna's defeat at the hand of Kas, this site is one of great magic and untold evil. The dead, including the archlich's former servants, still linger here. In addition, the entirety of the Tower counts as <em>desecrated ground</em> (DMG ch5). Undead in the tower have advantage on all saving throws.  </p>
<p>If Zarenival and/or Cochort are alive and still after the party, they will take any opportunity to trouble them in the Tower. Triggering traps, alerting enemies, opening/closing doors at inopportune times, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Underwater floors:</strong> Frigid Water rules in DMG chapter 5, but because magic and just how cold it is:
- cold resistance does not auto-succeed saves, only advantage
- count by round not by minute, saves start after # rounds = Con <em>modifier</em></p>

<p><strong>The Thing in the Shaft.</strong> A large, fleshy, blobby mass is settled into one corner of the entranceway, covered in short tendrils that drift gently in the water currents. Long ago, Narek was Kas' bastard son. Now, it is the Thing in the Shaft.  </p>

<li>Narek will attack the nearest creature, grab it, then continue with the others (if any) until it reaches the surface</li>

<p>This floor is entirely underwater. See the rules for underwater floors above.  </p>
<h4 id="floor-4">Floor 4</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is the floor that the party is able to enter through, thanks to a huge hole in the exterior wall</li>
<li>Due to either the tower sinking or the Nyr Dyv rising, this floor is now level with the surface of the lake</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>An enormous round hole pierces the outer shell of the tower as if it had been scooped out. Centuries of being lapped at and sprayed by the surface of the Nyr Dyv have thoroughly worn and weathered the stonework, and the floors and walls are now coated in slick ice. Whatever these rooms once were is now impossible to identify. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Slippery ice, more than outside. DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) when moving or fall prone</li>
<li>Rooms connected to hole are completely empty</li>
<li>Room behind doors is similarly empty except for the skeletal remains of two humanoids, half-encased in the ice<ul>
<li>DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) : skeletons are much newer than the tower's destruction, less than a century old</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spiral staircase:<ul>
<li>Up: Difficult ice stops partway up the stairs. Continues to Floor 5</li>
<li>Down: Surface of liquid water, somehow unfrozen, halfway down the second step. Continues to Floor 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="floor-5">Floor 5</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This floor is almost entirely exposed to the elements, and little of it remains. What remains of the stone walls is thin and largely rubble. A large portion of the floor has given away and is open to the level below. Some twenty or more feet above, the rest of the Tower floats in the air, shifting side to side as the wind gusts against it and it fights to stay in place. A sizable gap where the stone has crumbled away is visible in the floor of the bottom level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barely anything of note here. The party needs some way to get up to the next level, most likely through that hole. Can then drop a rope/ladder/rope-ladder down for anyone who needs help up. Flight, teleportation, whatever.  </p>
<h4 id="floor-6">Floor 6</h4>
<p>Entry:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Entering through gap in floor to another pair of severely weathered rooms, almost nothing of note in them other than the door that is still in good shape</li>
<li>Ladder/rope/rope-ladder can be attached and dropped down to lower floor</li>
</ul>
<p>Past the door:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Completely different other than everything being really dusty</li>
<li>Walls are seamless, smooth stone<ul>
<li>DC 15 Perception will notice molding of a serpent along where the floor meets the curved outer wall</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If lights are lit, there is a shadow in the corner that cannot be dispersed. This is the <strong>Shadow Demon</strong> Threndilla</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threndilla.</strong> At the height of Vecna's power, Threndilla was the Steward of the Rotted Tower. At that time she was a Marilith, but she was destroyed along with most of the Tower in the blast released by Kas striking Vecna down. Having been bound to the Tower by Vecna, her body was unable to reform in the Abyss and so she reformed as a Shadow Demon over the years that followed and has haunted the ruins in that form ever since.<br />
The fiend is still fiercely loyal to Vecna, who she refers to only as "the Master", but will not fight the party unless provoked. Even so, she knows she is weaker in this form than she used to be and will flee if hurt.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Threndilla has an intense hatred for Kas and will make this known, taking it out on anyone wielding his sword</li>
<li>The Sword(s) of Kas will strongly seek her destruction</li>
<li>It's been a very long time since Threndilla has had company</li>
<li>Threndilla speaks fondly of Acererak, calls him "dear". They were lovers before he left the Tower to begin some great project of his off to the East</li>
<li>She is <em>not</em> aware that Vecna is making his return, but does sense is presence on this plane more strongly than ever since he was struck down</li>
<li>Cooperates with the party for survival, but will also task them with removing the lingering apprentices on floors 8 and 9<ul>
<li>They have forsaken Vecna even while they live in the Tower and she will not stand by that, but cannot defeat them on her own</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Banners.</strong> Along the straight center wall are three banners on stands (rectangles on map), all faded with age but still identifiable. In order from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple black down-pointed sword on a white circle surrounded by a black field. Kas' personal banner. It has been shredded and hangs in multiple pieces from its hanger.<ul>
<li>Threndilla went at it with her claws in anger at his betrayal not long after she reformed, but she refuses to remove the banner because that is where it's supposed to be. She says she cannot let her personal feelings come ahead of her duties as Steward, if asked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A twisting black ouroboros in the center of a blood-red field. Higher and larger than the two others. Vecna's personal banner, and the emblem of the Occluded Empire.<ul>
<li>A large slash runs diagonally across the top of it, at one point severing it from the stand entirely. A DC 13 Perception check reveals that the two pieces are now held together by what seems to be physical shadowstuff. It was destroyed by Kas when he climbed the Tower intent on betrayal, and repaired by Threndilla in the years since</li>
<li>By this point the party should be realizing that this serpent motif has been showing up repeatedly in association with Vecna, and put together that it must have been his symbol before his Hand and Eye became important since that only occurred with Kas' betrayal</li>
<li>If asked about the Serpent, Threndilla tells the party (paraphrased from VR4, characters may remember a similar passage from reading the Book of Pain):
    &gt; The Serpent spoke directly to the Master. Some who dare call themselves mages only manipulate the tiniest aspects of the Serpent and call it magic. But the Master spoke to the Serpent, and the Serpent spoke back. It told him tales of his ancestors, the Ancient Brethren, and of how they discovered the Serpent so unimaginably long ago, when all worlds were young or even unborn. And I'm sure it continues to speak to him even now.  </li>
<li>The Sword(s) of Kas emanate hatred at the sight of this banner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A green, horned, bearded face with a gaping mouth on a black field. Acererak's personal banner.<ul>
<li>Similar to Vecna's, a large slash from Kas split this banner once and has since been repaired by Threndilla (noticeable with a DC 13 Perception check)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stairs.</strong> A wide, curved staircase continues upward to Floor 7.</p>
<p>Threndilla will explicitly follow the group if asked, otherwise she'll incorporeally keep an eye on them and chime in when relevant</p>
<h4 id="floor-7">Floor 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enter up stairs into open circular room with four pillars in the middle and two protrusions from the walls</li>
<li>Stairs continuing upwards on the other side of the room</li>
<li>Farthest pillar (closest to the upwards stairs) appears to be carved in the relief of a large armored skeletal figure<ul>
<li>It actually is a large armored skeletal figure in a niche formed in the pillar, but it's covered in dust</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other three pillars have a mosaic of a serpent wound around them in colored tiles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Barrier.</strong> As soon as a creature reaches the top of the stairs, a wavering, spectral barrier of slowly moving runes splits the room, from the protrusion in one wall to another. A raspy voice speaking directly into the mind of the creature, in their preferred language, says "Only those who sing the praises of the Whispered One may pass".</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the party's imagination fill in what the threat of the trap is</li>
<li>A creature must make "some sort of verbal supplication towards the greatness of Vecna" to pass through the barrier without issue</li>
<li>A creature who truly is dedicated to Vecna can speak some praise and pass through undeterred<ul>
<li>Technically a PC could do this, but the prerequisite (dedication to Vecna) would have severe repercussions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A creature who isn't dedicated to Vecna can attempt a DC 25 Charisma (Deception) check to fool the barrier of their devotion</li>
<li>A creature who doesn't put the effort in, or fails the Deception check, attempting to pass through the barrier will awaken the <strong>phylaskia</strong> in the far pillar<ul>
<li>Much of the dust falls away when it animates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balcony.</strong> Maybe there's a monster here? Maybe not?</p>
<ul>
<li>the balcony can mostly just be there as a way to fly up and around to the next balcony if the party really wants to avoid the barrier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="floor-8">Floor 8</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enter into curved passageway from stairs up from Floor 7</li>
<li>Outer wall has the figures of many different demons lined up along it, all in different poses</li>
<li>Inner wall is smooth<ul>
<li>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check (or passive) will locate the outline of a secret door in the wall, but not how to open it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the other end of the curved passage are the stairs up to Floor 9</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secret Door.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Opening the secret door requires pulling on "the third fiend's claw"</li>
<li>Count from the stairs up</li>
<li>Third claw, not claw of the third fiend</li>
<li>Keeping this puzzle basically unchanged because I like how silly it is</li>
<li>Pulling any incorrect claw causes the triggering creature to take 2d6 force damage</li>
<li>Correct claw opens the door</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secret Room.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some sort of laboratory</li>
<li>Various arcane apparatuses standing around, most of them hovering slightly to allow them to move</li>
<li>On a cabinet nearest the door is a closed transparent glass box with three oddly-shaped orbs made of dark red glass inside it</li>
<li>On the far end of the room are several pillars, suspended between which is a stretched-out, partially-flayed, humanoid figure<ul>
<li>Broken and exposed bones, long limbs, enormous claws</li>
<li>Coagulated blood collected in a trough below it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If anything in the room is moved, it disrupts the <strong>boneclaw</strong> which wakes up, breaks free, and attacks<ul>
<li>Turn 1 it gets surprise but uses its first attack to break free</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Rooms.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only accessible through ladder from Floor 9</li>
<li>One is Meshivi's quarters, very barebones</li>
<li>The other is a lab/work area</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="floor-9">Floor 9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enter up from Floor 8 into a large figure-8 shaped room</li>
<li>Arcane glyphs and diagrams decorate the walls, floor, ceilings, and pillars</li>
<li>Two skeletal robed figures mill about. One is attending to a spell on an altar, the other is reviewing a spell circle on the wall and notices anyone coming up the stairs unless sneaking</li>
<li>On both sides of the door out to the balcony are banners of the Occluded Empire in exquisite condition, kept now as objects of worship for the apprentices</li>
<li>Ladder down to remaining rooms of Floor 8</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Lingering Apprentices.</strong> After Kas' betrayal, several of Vecna's apprentices were left stranded in the upper levels of the tower until it drifted down towards the surface of the Nyr Dyv. These apprentices, feeling remorse at their failure to protect their master in the moment of his betrayal desperate to continue living, attempted to rush their ascension to lichdom and in doing so became <strong>deathlocks</strong>. But as the centuries wore on they came to believe that Vecna had actually failed them, and turned their devotion and study towards the Serpent, earning them the ire of Threndilla. Their belief is that if they are able to produce sufficiently impressive spells, it will earn them the attention of the Serpent as Vecna once had.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Meshivi: <strong>deathlock mastermind</strong>, they/them, out brooding on balcony. The leader of the cabal due to seniority, the most devoted to their current mission</li>
<li>Am: <strong>deathlock</strong>, they/them, attending to the altar</li>
<li>Bevom: <strong>deathlock</strong>, they/them, down in lab on Floor 8 working</li>
<li>Cezeluh: <strong>deathlock</strong>, they/them, reviewing the spell circle on the wall</li>
</ul>
<p>At one point they counted seven in total, but the other three proved to be unworthy of the Serpent and had their power, intelligence, and personalities drained to empower the others. The names of those three are now forgotten, but they linger still as <strong>deathlock wights</strong>.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Meshivi does most of the talking</li>
<li>The apprentices do not want to fight, they need help</li>
<li>They have all but exhausted the resources of the parts of the tower they have access to, using nearly everything as spell components<ul>
<li>This helps explain why there isn't any loot anywhere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They cannot get up to Level 11 without the teleporter, but it is inoperable and they haven't been able to restart it<ul>
<li>Threndilla refuses to fix it for them (or she doesn't know how to? or she's saying she knows to piss them off but actually doesn't know?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Offer the party safe passage and any loot they want from the upper levels in exchange for their help</li>
<li>If asked, will give the instructions for the secret door on Floor 8 as a show of good faith<ul>
<li>"Pull down on the third fiend's claw"<ul>
<li>Intentionally vague, see above</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If asked about the three items in the case from the secret room, they will explain that those are part of the key to the Shadowed Room. That's the only reason they haven't used them as spell components</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="floor-10">Floor 10</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mostly empty room, lots of scattered detritus</li>
<li>Curved nook against one side</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An Echo of the Past.</strong> The arcane resonances tied to the teleporter causes a creature to experience a spectral vision of the past after about a minute in the room. The image of Vecna stumbles out of the teleporter and into the center of the room, then Kas leaps out of the teleporter after him, wielding a vicious dark shortsword and going for Vecna's back. The archlich snaps around and catches the blade in a magical shield, stopping Kas in his tracks before launching him into the wall. Then the vision fades.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cool scene plus helps establish the teleporter in case the party just kills the deathlocks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teleporter.</strong> An ancient, inactive teleporter is inscribed into the nook in the room, long dormant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Evard can reactivate it, he's good at conjuration magic, but it could take up to eight hours of work</li>
<li>Otherwise, someone can fly up to the next floor's balcony and try to reactivate it from the other side</li>
<li>Either way, as soon as it is active, the apprentices betray the party</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="floor-11">Floor 11</h4>
<ul>
<li>Characters will either enter from teleporter or balcony</li>
<li>Threndilla can explain that since the apprentices don't come up here she's been able to keep this floor and the rest above very clean</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balcony.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exposed to the elements</li>
<li>At some point a group of wyverns came to roost here, they died and became transformed by the Tower's magic into <strong>gloamwings</strong></li>
<li>Drop <strong>gloamwings</strong> wherever on the balcony works best for action, but they can't go inside</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teleporter Room.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not much here other than the teleporter. Good place to rest</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Library.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A small library that was available to the apprentices in the past</li>
<li>All the books are in Old Flan</li>
<li>Also they all animate and attack (<strong>Swarms of Animated Books</strong>)<ul>
<li>Evard is insistent that they are dispatched without significant damage, otherwise untold knowledge may be lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Connecting Room.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing really here, just doors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Laboratory.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mix between dissection room and torture chamber</li>
<li>Many horrific experiments were carried out here by Vecna personally</li>
<li>The echo of the centuries of torture carried out here have coalesced in the centuries since and manifest as a <strong>gallows speaker</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="floor-12">Floor 12</h4>
<ul>
<li>Threndilla will not come up here, says she was never allowed to without Vecna's express permission and is still bound by that</li>
<li>Four huge, faded, banners, each with the symbol of the Occluded Empire</li>
<li>Apparatus in front of one of the banners, three large mirrors that can be individually rotated (6-axis)</li>
<li>Stairs up lead to Floor 13 through a large trapdoor in the floor</li>
<li>This is the Mirror Room (VR50) with some changes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Mirror Dance.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the banners except the one behind the mirrors has a complete symbol inside the circle of the ouroboros</li>
<li>Each mirror has a partial outline of a symbol somewhere on it</li>
<li>Holding up the three "orbs" from the secret room on Floor 8 in the right place and orientation, and angling the mirrors right can line up the outlines and the objects to match the shapes</li>
<li>Players don't need to actually match the mirrors/shapes/objects one-to-one, just realize the relationship, then:<ul>
<li>DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to match everything and find orientations</li>
<li>DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hold the objects in the right place</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="floor-13">Floor 13</h4>
<p><strong>Nothing.</strong> The room is entirely empty when first entered.</p>
<h3 id="leaving-the-tower">Leaving the Tower</h3>
<ul>
<li>If Narek hasn't already been dealt with, the presence of two Swords of Kas as the party leave is enough to bring it out to attack the party</li>
<li>(semi-party specific, since it's not written in that Cylene is with the Rhennee, that's just for us) If there isn't already enough urgency from the party putting together that Virianis Dast and Cylene are in danger, have the party (somehow, again this is party-specific) be contacted by the Rhennee that they are under attack</li>
<li>Evard is a very good conjurer and can teleport all of them back to Verbobonc</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="narek-the-thing-in-the-shaft">Narek (The Thing in the Shaft)</h2>
<p>(Although there's no shaft anymore in this version.)  </p>
<p>Unspeakable Horror (VRGtR) with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Malleable Mass</li>
<li>Beguiling Hex</li>
<li>Grasping Tentacle (maybe also Corrosive Pseudopod?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, non-standard additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire and cold damage immunity</li>
<li>Nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, slashing resistance</li>
<li>Charm condition immunity</li>
<li>Immutable Form (cannot have its form altered by spells or effects)</li>
<li>15' reach with tentacle attacks (Maybe more? It's 40' in VR, but that might be too much. Will depend on map size.)</li>
<li>Unusual nature (No need to eat, drink, sleep or breathe)</li>
<li>Swim speed: 40ft</li>
<li>Climb speed: 20ft</li>
<li>5 tentacles (5 creatures grappled)</li>
<li>Grapple also restrains</li>
<li>Tentacle slam from Neo-Otyugh</li>
<li>Bunch of stat adjustments. See DDB</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>For pacing, try to contrive a way to teleport them back to Verbobonc after this.<br />
Evard can teleport them, but stays behind to study the tower and the Shadowed Room.  </p>
